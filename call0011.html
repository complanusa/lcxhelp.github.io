<h1>Standard Reports Functions -- Category 11</h1> <p> 


<h3>Description, and Enabling control in WinPCS:</h3>
<p>1. STDREP reports, category LD refer to a file and a function in the FILES and 
FUNCTION fields.</p>
<p>2. In response to any menu choice in WinPCS where the L action is defined.</p>

<h3>Disallowed functions:</h3>
DDE callback and document-drawing functions are only  available inside the DDE 
callback and Printing callback  environments.  There is however no restrictions on 
initiating printing or DDE-operations. This is really the main purpose of these functions 
anyway.

<h3>LCX files:</h3>
One or more files are referenced in the FILES field in the STDREP record.

<h3>Callback functions:</h3>
The function is defined in the FUNCTION field. It is called as:
function(reportname)
and its return value is ignored.

<h3>Execution context:</h3>
Not shared and not re-entered.

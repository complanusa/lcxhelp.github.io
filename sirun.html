<h1>Information on the SIRUN subsystem</h1>

<p> File Date: July 29 2003

<a name="Introduction"></a>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The SIRUN subsystem is made for continually running SI reports or other jobs
without much intervention, so that a slow network doesnt get bogged down in reporting. 

<p>To this end, the program SIRUN.EXE is used. It is a Windows GUI program, and should be set up
on the machine where the data files are.  SIRUN uses a file in the system directory,
<a href="#SIRUNinifile">SIRUN.INI</a> 
which among other things contains the list of activities SIRUN is to perform. This
file is read on startup, and displayed on the window in a list there.   

<p>To run, the menu selection
<b>Commands/Go</b> is used, this will open a big odometer window showing what is happening.  To stop the
looping, the STOP button on this odometer window is used, this will allow the current run to be 
completed and then the looping will stop. 


<h2>The SIRUN.INI file</h2>

<p>This file contains a section [SIRUN] with the list of things to be done, as shown on the window.  
Each action is specified as a line on section file in the format:

<p><em>priority macrofile macrofunction table parameter </em>

<p>In addition, the program stops when it encounters lines beginning with <b>;</b> 
which can be used as trailing comment lines, useful for explaining details in the file.  
An example of such a section is shown here:

<pre>
[SIRUN]
1 0:\sirun.lcx DoSIrun CERTHC1 A11
1 0:\sirun.lcx DoSIrun CERTHC1 P1
3 0:\sirun.lcx DoSIrun CERTHC1 B11
; priority macrofile macrofunction table refrepkey
; DoSIrun(string table, string refrepkey, string itemid)
; macrofile macrofunction table refrepkey itemid
</pre>

The <em>priority</em> field indicates how frequently any job is to be done in comparison to the others.  
When looping, a set of counters are maintained, one per job. This is initially set to the priority-number, 
and then decremented once for each job. When the counter reaches 0, the job is performed and the counter
becomes reset to the priority number again. Thus, the lower the number is, the more frequently that job is 
done compared to others with higher numbers.  In the above, B11 will be done only 1/3 as often as A11 and P1.

<p>The <em>macrofile</em> and <em>macrofunction</em> represents the work to be done for that job. This function will be
called once per record in the specified <em>table</em> Once the table is exhausted, that job is finished
and the next job will be performed. 

<p>The last items on the line are parameters to be passed to the macrofunction. These are not used directly by
SIRUN but are simply passed on into the macrofunction for it to work with.  In the example above, these are
keys into the REFREP table. 

<h2>Calling the macrofunction</h2>

<p>The rest of WinPCS code is interacted with through the specified macrofunction expected to be in the named file.  
The location of the file would typically be the system directory, and we may specify the numbered drives for this.
(see the discussion of these under <a href="lcxh.html#ExpandPath">ExpandPath( )</a> )

<p>The function will be called as: 
<pre><em>function</em><b>(</b><em>table</em><b>, </b><em>parameter</em><b>, </b><em>itemid</em><b>)</b></pre>

<p>The argument <em>table</em> is the table as initially specified, the <em>parameter</em> is the 
trailing parameter as given in the 
<a href="#SIRUNinifile">SIRUN.INI</a> 
[SIRUN] section, and the <em>itemid</em> is the value of the 
main field in the current worked-on record in this table.   This is the field specified as ITEMFLD in
the CXDICT record for this table. 

<p>Most of the usual system functions as listed in the 
<a href="lcxh.html#Functions.20available.20in.20the.2016.2dbit.20system"> Macro Help</a> file for 
16-bit clients are available. The exceptions are the functions opening or dealing with MDI child windows,
notably 

<a href="lcxh.html#runentry">runentry( )</a> ,
<a href="lcxh.html#Entrydialog">Entrydialog ( )</a> ,
<a href="lcxh.html#runview">runview( )</a> ,
<a href="lcxh.html#Viewdialog">Viewdialog( )</a> ,
<a href="lcxh.html#CreateReport">CreateReport( )</a> ,

<!-- <a href="lcxh.html#varSI">varSI( )</a> , -->

<p>The <a href="lcxh.html#message">message( )</a> 
function, all the other functions that open a dialog window, including the 
<a href="lcxh.html#CounterHere">Odometer</a>, are all available.  However, while useful
for debugging, apart from the 
<a href="lcxh.html#CounterHere">Odometer</a>
ones, these are not suitable for unattended operation, since they stop and wait for user interaction. 

<p>Notably, the quiet and CSV-file generating variants of the 
<a href="lcxh.html#varSI">varSI( )</a> function are quite useful.  More on this anon. 

<h2>Configuration</h2>

The 
<a href="#SIRUNinifile">SIRUN.INI</a> 
file is expected to be in the System directory, and any files it refers to should
also be present. For the SIRUN.EXE program, this is usually located with the other
common EXE and DLL files, in the directory PROG or similar. The shortcut
should have the system directory as the working directory, same as the usual WINPCS.EXE has.

<p><b>NB!</b> If you also want to run WinPCS on the same machine, with SIRUN in the background,
make sure that the properties for the SIRUN shortcut has the "run in separate 
memory space" checkbox turned on. 

If this is not turned on, then expect both SIRUN and WinPCS to become unstable and crash-prone as 
they will be fighting for some common resources in the DLLs and the system, as well as 
not agreeing on whether certain DLLs are present or not.  This will cause trouble. 

<p>This "run in separate memory space" option should work on all most recent version of Windows, 
I have it here on windows 2000.  (Another version of the startup WinPCS.EXE has been made which does not
use dynamical loading. This causes no crashes, but WinPCS remains less than perfect
responsive during SI loading phases of the SIRUN jobs. This version also is mising the -D option, and
does produce a long painful slew of errormessages, so it has not been publicised.)

<p>If not aimed correctly, it will not start, and instead display a message about some DLL missing, 
most likely CWULIB or ANCHOR. 

<p>The macro files referred to should of course also be present, if not, they will be skipped, and 
only the ones present will be run.

<h2>Example: Running SI reports unattended</h2>
The contents of the above SIRUN.INI file shows how A-sheet, punchlists, and B-sheet indexes may
be produced unattended. All other configuration info is in the SIRUN.LCX file, as part of
the function <a href="#DoSIrun">DoSIrun( )</a> there. 

<p>The parameter argument is used as the REFREP key, then the proper SI-report reference is found there,
and this is used for finding the proper SI-report code. The output file name is placed in a directory
under REPORTS, as per the statement:

<pre> 
    outfile = concat("9:\REPORTS\CANNED\", 
            table, "\", itemID, refrepkey, ".CSV");
</pre>

This convention is defined in this LCX file only, and there is nothing hard-coded anywhere else. 
It is possible to integrate this into the PATHS section in WinPCS.INI, but nothing has been done
along these lines at the moment.  

This is just one of
several possible naming conventions. The filename must be less than 8 characters, remember this is
the old 16-bit environment. In the system here, where system numbers are 3-digits, the filenames will
be in the style <b>400A11.CSV</b>, <b>400P1.CSV</b>, and <b>400B1.CSV</b>, in a subdirectory CERTHC1. 

<p>This is extensible, so other jobs running SI reports on different levels (CERTMILE, CERTSITE)
would not be that difficult. 

<p>To actually run the SI report, the function varSI( ) with the new C parameter is used, and this
means that instead of opening an filling a Report View, we instead want the data to go into a CSV
file specified as one of the later arguments.  Later, there is another function, 
<a href="lcxh.html#cannedindex">cannedindex( )</a>, which can be called from within WinPCS to read and 
display this CSV file as a Report. 

<p>Since these files are standard CSV-files it should not be difficult to be able to open Excel 
on them either, for further processing. 

<p>The <a href="#varSI">varSI( )</a> function accepts the numbered-drive path for its output file, it is
not necessary (but neither is it harmful) to use <a href="#ExpandPath">ExpandPath( )</a> on this path. 


<h2>Running the canned index reports in WinPCS</h2>
In order to select and run these reports in WinPCS, a new LCX system function,
<a href="lcxh.html#cannedindex">cannedindex( )</a> , is created.

This takes a subset of the arguments specified for the standard 
<a href="lcxh.html#varSI ">varSI ( )</a> function, 
and reads the data-file, which is expected to have been created using the
previous call to <a href="lcxh.html#varSI">varSI("C", ... )</a>.  
The linkage inside WinPCS is via DDMATRIX,
where a new target, such as WinPCS:REPORT, must be used for running a function 
that does the actual selection, REFREP lookups, and then calls this 
<a href="lcxh.html#cannedindex">cannedindex( )</a> 
function. 

The function that does all this is in the file SIRUN.LCX as well, the
function is called <a href="#StoredReport">StoredReport( )</a>.

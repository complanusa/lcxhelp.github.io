<h1>For all records functions -- Category 16</h1>

<h3>Enabling control in WinPCS:</h3>
<p>Selection of a file and function in the Macro [M()...] dialog in INSPECT and SYNFARE. </p>

<h3>LCX files</h3>
<p>The file is selected as part of the dialog. So is the function. Note that the functions in the selected
file as well as all the Global functions in the client are available. </p>

<h3>Arguments and Return Value</h3>
<p>The function takes no arguments, and returns a value indicating whether this record is to
be updated or not. For Inspect, this means updating the table; for SYNFARE this means updating the
data in the Report View. The actual return value is specified in the Dialog, the usual convention is to
return 1 for update and 0 for do not update, but this is merely a convention and is not hardcoded in any way.</p>

<h3>Disallowed functions:</h3>
<p>DDE callback and document-drawing functions are only available inside the DDE 
callback and Printing callback  environments.  Though there is no restrictions on 
initiating printing or DDE-operations, this does not seem to make much sense for 
typically long-winded and repeated jobs like these.
For the same reason, the message( ), input( ), yesno( ) or question( ) 
functions, although legal, are not very useful beyond debugging purposes.</p>

<h3>Special functions:</h3>
<p>
<b>InValue(field )</b><br/>
This returns the value of the specified field in the record of the input under consideration. The input 
may be from the SYNFARE view or the table being INSPECTed. </p>

<p>
<b>OutValue(field, value) </b><br/>
This prepares placing the selected value to a specified field in the data set, either the table 
or the SYNFARE report.  Only if the record is to be updated will these values make it into the permanent
set.</p>

<p>
<b>SourceName()</b><br/>
<b>TargetName()</b><br/>
These function returns the table name of the main table being INSPECTed, or the file-name (shown in the title)
for SYNFARE report views. Both names are synonyms for the same function. </p> 

<h3>Execution context:</h3>
<p>One execution context that lasts from the first to the last record in each invocation,
and is re-entered for every record. A Global variable set up in one early invocation is available in 
subsequent fields. </p>

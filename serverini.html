<h1>SERVER.INI file reference</h1>
<!-- File Date: September 13 2006 --> 
<p> File Date: 2010-07-02</p>

<p>This references the configuration file for the server. This applies to the 
Windows version.  Like other .ini files, this file has a number of sections
with entries in them, and the sections may appear in any order. </p>

<p>The sections are: <br/>
<a href="#section.20options">[options]</a><br/>
<a href="#section.20periodic">[periodic]</a><br/>
<a href="#section.20xfer">[xfer]</a><br/>
<a href="#section.20cdat">[cdat]</a><br/>

<p>Section and entry names are case-insensitive. Simple keyword-style 
values such as On, Off, Yes, No, are also case-insensitive. Filenames
and descriptions are generally case-sensitive.</p>

<h2>[options]</h2>
<p>Server options are all those miscellaneous things that do not fit
in any other section, and do not generalize enough to warrant their

<a name="options.unc"></a>
<h3>unc=</h3>
<p>This controls whether UNC paths can be used.  It is set to either
<b>unc=1</b> for UNC paths allowed, or <b>unc=0</b> for no UNC paths. In
this latter case, a mapped drive letter must be used.  </p>

<a name="options.statrees"></a> <a name="options.stadlg"></a> <a name="options.starep"></a>
<h3>stadlg= statrees= starep=</h3>
<p>These three entries indicate which ini-files are used for 
status-dialog, (STADLG), status-treelines (STATREES) and 
status-report layouts (STAREP).   </p>

<p>Traditionally, the status-dialog information is in the STADLG.INI file,
and tree-lines and reports are either all in STATREES.INI or they may be
split between STATREES.INI and STAREP.INI.  The three entries here indicate
the location and names of these three files, for example. </p>

<p><b> stadlg=0:\stadlg.ini<br/>
statrees=0:\statrees.ini<br/>
starep=0:\starep.ini<br/></b></p>

<p>The major difference tends to be, on some really old systems, that 
the report-layouts are with the tree-line information in the STATREES.INI
file, and the entry for this would then become<br/>
<b>starep=0:\statrees.ini</b></p>

<p>Note that on Linux systems, the file-names (but not the INI file entries)
are case-sensitive, and the file-names are likely to be lower-case. The most
likely entries on such systems are: </p>

<p><b> STADLG=0:/stadlg.ini<br/>
statrees=0:/statrees.ini<br/>
starep=0:/starep.ini<br/></b></p>

<p>Incidentially, these will work fine on Windows systems as well. </p>
<p>The slash separating the directory can be either way; the common unix
convention of using the backslash as an escape-code is not applied here. 
</p>

<a name="options.debug"></a>
<h3>debug=</h3>
<p>This indicates whether serial-port or other debug-tracing 
is turned on or off. The default value and the one usually 
desired is <b>Debug=OFF</b>.</p>

<p>Debugging info can be directed to a serial line, 
or another machine on the network running 
<a href="netdebug.html#netrx">netrx</a> or 
<a href="netdebug.html#udprx">udprx</a>:</p>

<p> <b>Debug=udp </b><i>ip-address</i><b>:</b><i>port</i> sends the
information to a udprx program running on the machine with indicated
IP-address and listening on the indicated port. This is frequently chosen
in the vicinity of 16385. Note that several udprx instances can run
at the same time, to receive messages from the server and from the 
client, whose WINPCS.INI will have a similar DEBUG= setting.</p>

<p> 
<b>Debug=net </b><i>ip-address</i><b>:</b><i>port</i> or <br/>
<b>Debug=tcp </b><i>ip-address</i><b>:</b><i>port</i> <br/>
makes the server send information using the TCP protocol, to 
any netrx listeners that can display it. As is the case with 
udprx, there may be more than one of these udprx listeners on 
separate ports, handling emissions from servers and clients.</p>

<p>For debugging on serial lines, there are the entries<br/>
<b>Debug=COM1</b> <br/>
<b>Debug=COM2</b> (and so on) This
sends info on the named serial line with 9600 Baud, for a dumb terminal to 
pick it up at the far end. </p>

<p>On the Linux server, serial line debugging can also be specified as<br/>
<b>Debug=TTYS </b><i>device</i><b>:</b><i>baudrate</i><br/>
instead, where the device is the path name of the device file. For 
example,<br/>
<b>Debug=TTYS /dev/ttyS0:9600</b><br/>
<b>Debug=TTYS /dev/ttyUSB0:9600</b><br/>
</p>

<p>The names COM1, COM2 etc. will be translated to 
/dev/ttyS0, /dev/ttyS1 and so on.</p>

<!-- <a href="serverini.html#options.debuglevel"> </a> -->
<!-- <a href="serverini.html#options.debug"> </a> -->

<a name="options.debuglevel"></a>
<h3>debuglevel=</h3>
<p>This can be <br/>
<b>debuglevel=DLL</b> <br/>for showing all WinPCS server activity,
or <br/><b>debuglevel=LCX</b><br/> for capturing the output of 
<a href="lcxh.html#trace">trace(&nbsp;)</a> and 
<a href="lcxh.html#message">message(&nbsp;)</a>
on the server-side <b>LCX</b> code.</p>

<a name="options.endpoint"></a>
<h3>endpoint=</h3>
<p>The WinPCS server is always set to listen on some network port.
For the Windows DCERPC version using ncacn_ip_tcp and for all TCP versions
this is the TCP port number.  When set, this overrides the various defaults
that are assigned via settings in ANCHORS.DLL or given by the Dispatcher.</p>

<p>The default is the port number as defined as the Endpoint 
in the ANCHORS.DLL or the port number given by the Dispatcher. </p>

<p> <a href="winpcsini.html#endpoint">
A corresponding entry will have to be present on the client, 
in WinPCS.INI, unless the default value is acceptable.  </a> </p>


<p>The <a href="https://www.iana.org/">IANA</a> has allocated 

<a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml?search=5166">
port 5166 as available for WinPCS</a>. 
This port number is usually what is set as the default in the 
ANCHORS.DLL and ANCHORC.DLL files.  </p>

<p>Note that although any endpoint number will work with the WinPCS Client, 
browsers will not access certain ports by default, since accessing the
standard servers on these ports with a http client will be unsafe,
and/or disruptive. These restricted ports include the following:</p>

<a name="options.dllsinfo"></a>
<h3>dllsinfo=</h3>
<p>This is 1 for the server emitting info on the DLLs on its console window
on startup. Set to 0 to make the server quiet about this.  
Default is 1 for on.</p>

<a name="options.auth"></a>
<h3>AUTH= (DCERPC) </h3>
<p>The AUTH= setting is only used with the DCERPC version of the WinPCS 
server (W31SVR.EXE) and the matching version of the client-side NEXUS31.DLL. 
The TCP version of the WinPCS server, (W31TCP.EXE) does not use this 
setting. </p>

<p>For the DCERPC version of WinPCS, this and its matching entry on 
the client-side WinPCS.INI file there controls authentication of the 
DCERPC calls. For Windows XP SP 2 and later, the setting must be AUTH=ON
for the server, and usually have to be AUTH=ON for the client as well. 
The setting on the client must generally be the same as on the server.</p>

<a name="options.corelock"></a>
<h3>corelock=</h3>
<p>This controls whether the CORE table is used for strict 
uniqueness enforcement,
or if it is just advisory, applying to Exception Reports. This is set to 
0 for advisory. Default is 1, strict enforcement, but some projects may need
to have an override. The setting is read and cached, so the server has to be
restarted for changes here to take effect.</p>

<a name="options.dateformat"></a>
<h3>dateformat=</h3>
<p>This controls the formatting of dates in the system. This has been 
shown to depend on not just the locale setting of the server machine, but 
also which user the WinPCS server runs as.  This gets confusing, so we have
to make sure that a particular WinPCS installation makes all dates formatted
the same. All clients connecting to the server will use this date format,
not the format defined on the client.</p>

<p>Typical values would be: <b>yyyy/mm/dd</b> or <b>yyyy-mm-dd</b> for two
common variations on the ISO-8601 standard date format. <b>dd/mm-yyyy</b> would
be a useful one in most of Europe, and the Americans would probably like
<b>mm/dd/yyyy</b>. Even though the year part could be given as <b>yy</b>, 
suggesting 2 digits; WinPCS will always display and stor the full
4 digits for a year number. On input, 2-digit years will map into 
the range 1990-2089, as discussed in 
<a href="y2k.html"> WinPCS and the Year 2000</a>.</p>

<p>The default is <b>yyyy/mm/dd</b>.</p>

<p>The interpreted settings are: <br/>
<b>yy</b> for 2-digit year<br/>
<b>yyyy</b> for 4-digit year<br/>
<b>m</b> for month 1-12<br/>
<b>mm</b> for month 01-12<br/>
<b>mmm</b> for abbreviated month name Jan Feb Mar etc.<br/>
<b>mmmm</b> for full month name January February March etc.<br/>
<b>d</b> for day 1-31<br/>
<b>dd</b> for day 01-31<br/>
<b>ddd</b> for abbreviated weekday Mon Tue Wed etc.<br/>
<b>dddd</b> for full weekday name Monday Tuesday Wednesday and so on<br/>
</p>

<a name="options.wwwroot"></a>
<h3>wwwroot= (TCP) </h3>

<p>The WinPCS server can respond to http GET requests, and
if the object to be got is a file, this setting indicates where
in the directory tree the file can be found. Some URLs are 
treated in special ways, see
<a href="webio.html">WEBIO Browser functions</a> 
for these. Other URLs that refer to actual files makes the 
server expect to find them here.</p>

<a name="options.htrestrict"></a>
<a name="options.htrealm"></a>
<h3>htrestrict= and htrealm= (TCP) </h3>
<p>When serving web pages, the htrestrict entry identifies a directory
part of the url that has to be limited only to people allowed to use
WinPCS. The entered username and password are checked against what is
in WUSER and if the user is known there, he may see the web-page
in question. Default is blank, which means to pass all pages without
any log-in requirements.</p>

<p>The htrealm= entry is there to identify to the user what the
web-page in question is meant for, and this string appears in the
username/password dialog that the web browser client pops up. 
The default value is "WinPCS Project"</p>

<a name="options.dispatcher"></a>
<h3>dispatcher= (TCP) </h3>
<p> On installation using TCP systems where a dispatcher process
is running, this is set to the address of the server where the dispatcher
is running. This is often the same as the WinPCS server itself, which
allows the setting to be <b>dispatcher=127.0.0.1</b>. If there is a cluster of
servers, the dispatcher should run on one of them, and this setting is
then the address of the server where the dispatcher runs. </p>

<p>Installations not using a dispatcher should have this entry
omitted or set to address <b>0.0.0.0</b>. </p>

<a name="options.sitelimit"></a>
<h3>sitelimit=</h3>
<p>This serves as a master switch for the mechanism that allows
data in hierarchies to be limited based on the user's defined 
values of the SITE_CODE field in WUSER.  Default is <b>0</b> for off, 
set to <b>1</b> to enable this mechanism. There needs to be the correct
field-names in the ITEMRELFLD in all the records of CXDICT for 
the mechanism to work properly. </p>

<p>See also the discussion of <b>ITEMRELFLD</b> in the
<a href="cxdict.html">documentation on CXDICT</a>. </p>

<a name="options.csvdata"></a>
<h3>csvdata=</h3>

<a name="options.defgroup"></a>
<h3>defgroup=</h3>
<p>This indicates which of the groups listed in the [groups] section
is to be the default for this system. There is now three possible
options for these, but they will require an appropriate set of 
server-side DLLs in order to work properly. </p>

<p>Systems using Pervasive will have <b>defgroup=WINPCS71</b></p>

<a name="options.clientdir"></a>
<h3>clientdir=</h3>
<p>This is the location of the co-located client files directory, 
usually named system32. </p>

<a name="options.resynchlog"></a>
<h3>resynchlog=</h3>

<a name="options.periodic"></a>
<h3>periodic=</h3>
<p>This entry controls any periodic jobs. These usually are scheduled
to take place one or more times every 24 hours at specified times. Details
for this is in the [periodic] section. This entry is set to ON to turn 
this functionality on, or left to OFF or absent, to turn it off. </p>

<a name="options.updatelog"></a>
<h3>updatelog=</h3>
<p>This entry controls if the log-file for recording update-activities
("blue tree") on clients is turned on or not. The value of this should be
<b>on</b> for logging, when the actions are recorded in a file
<b>updates.log</b> in the server directory.</p>

<a name="options.shadow"></a>
<h3>shadow=</h3>
<p>This specifies the location of the shadow or backup files
to be generated when the function
<a href="lcxh.html#FilePutShadow">FilePutShadow( )</a> 
is called, to transfer a file to the server, and make the backup copy
(the "shadow") at the same time. Think of the British "shadow government",
rather than the ominous element of Jungian psychology.  </p>

<p>This is a path, possibly defined on some other disk volume or server
different from the one the main WinPCS system is located.</p>

<p>When not defined, there will be no shadowing made of these files and 
<a href="lcxh.html#FilePutShadow">FilePutShadow( )</a> 
will work the same as 
<a href="lcxh.html#FilePut">FilePut( )</a>.

<a name="options.shadowserver"></a>
<a name="options.shadowport"></a>
<h3>shadowserver=</h3>
<h3>shadowport=</h3>

<p>Refers to another server somewehere that can receive data
for remote back-up (sfile.c) of these shadowed files moved using
<a href="lcxh.html#FilePutShadow">FilePutShadow(&nbsp;)</a> when the shadowing is requested. 
The shadowserver name must be non-blank for this to happen, and the
shadowport will be the port that this server listens on.  </p>

<p>This receiver server stores the files in directories identifying
the project date and time of the file being stored. The same file stored
later will be located in a different location.</p>

<p>The function <a href="lcxh.html#RemoteBack">RemoteBack(&nbsp;)</a> allows transferring to the 
remote server without depending on this shadowing mechanism. It might be useful
to use <a href="lcxh.html#serverinistring">serverinistring(&nbsp;)</a>
in order to re-use the values of <tt>shadowserver</tt> and <tt>shadowport</tt>
from the server.ini file, instead of having them hardcoded in all the various calls.  </p>


<hr/>
<a name="section.20periodic"></a>
<h2>[periodic]</h2>

<p>Section <b>[periodic]</b> contains a number of entries describing the 
jobs to be done.  The entry <b>count=</b> indicates how many such jobs,
and each one of these is indexed as <b>1=</b>, <b>2=</b> etc. </p>

<p>The right hand side of the job entry inidicates the time and 
which macrofunction to be run at that time. 
For example, the periodic section shown here:</p>

<pre>
[periodic]
count=2
1=D (01:30) FormSICache
2=H (6 21 36 51) UpdatePlots
</pre>

<p>means that there are two jobs, one of which is to run the function
<b>FormSICache()</b> once a day, at 01:30 (1.30 AM) and the other one
is to run the function UpdatePlots() every 15 minutes throughout the
day, at 6, 21, 36, and 51 minutes past each hour throughout the day. </p>

<p>The clock-times or minute-marks are listed inside the ( ). D indicates
Daily actions, and H indicates Hourly actions. </p>

<p>Like all other macrocode on the server, this function is expected to be
in one of the files indicated for the server, which it loads at startup, 
section <b>[LCX]</b> entry <b>files=</b>. </p>

<hr/>
<a name="section.20xfer"></a>
<h2>[xfer]</h2>
<p>There is one entry, <b>folders=</b>, which lists somethinge 
</p>

<h3>Example:</h3>
<pre>
[xfer]
folders=9:\data 9:\back-up
</pre>


<hr/>
<a name="section.20cdat"></a>
<h2>[cdat]</h2>

<p>There are 3 entries defined here:</p>
<pre>
<b>subsymbase=</b>
<b>tracekey=</b>
<b>barcodediscovery=</b>
</pre>

<h3>subsymbase= and tracekey=</h3>

<p>The two entries <b>subsymbase</b> and <b>tracekey</b> are used in the CDAT Transfer phase, 
for it to find the suitable grouping objects. In many projects, the defaults referring to CERTAC1
are sufficient, but some project may also use WORKPACK objects, for some of the 
check-sheets that are scanned-in and have status on them set.</p>

<p>The entry <b>subsymbase=</b> should list all the various tables (including CERTAC1)
that may be used for grouping, and the entry <b>tracekey=</b> is a list of the 
corresponding <a href="lcxh.html#traceconn">traceconn( )</a> 
search entry in <b> STATREES.INI</b> section <b>[$TRACE]</b>. </p>

<p>The default values of this section and its entries, when it is not present, is:</p>

<pre>
[cdat]
subsymbase=CERTAC1
tracekey=FIND_CERTAC1
</pre>

<h3>Example:</h3>
<p>On a project where either CERTAC1 or WORKPACK are used for grouping, the following
entries in this section will be appropriate:</p>
<pre>
[cdat]
subsymbase=CERTAC1 WORKPACK
tracekey=FIND_CERTAC1 FIND_WORKPACK
</pre>

<p>Of course, the entry <b>FIND_WORKPACK=</b> must also exist in STATREES.INI in the 
<b>[$TRACE]</b> section there.</p>

<a name="section.20cdat.barcodediscovery"></a>
<h3>barcodediscovery=</h3>

<p>The entry <b>barcodediscovery=</b> is expected to refer to an LCX function being called 
when CDAT works its way through barcodes during verification.   The default is NOOP
which is taken to mean there is no such function defined. The function runs on the client,
so all client-side functions, notably 
<a href="lcxh.html#message">message(&nbsp;)</a>
will work as expected.</p>

<p>This function is called as per: </p>

<pre>
<em>action+index+newident</em><b> = bd_function(</b><em>barcodeset</em><b>, </b><em>count</em><b>);</b>
</pre>

<p>The function is expected to be found in the file referenced in 
<a href="winpcsini.html#section.20Rconn">
winpcs.ini section [rconn] entry stadlg=
</a></p>

<p>The purpose of this function is to allow abbreviated barcode strings. Some projects may have long
tag numbers, and when these are concatenated with check-sheet numbers they may overflow
the available space.  This allows some kind of project-specific abbreviations to take place.</p>

<p>Its return value is expected to be a three-part set, <tt>makeset(action, index, newident)</tt>.</p>

<p><tt>newident</tt> is the new identity. </p>

<p><tt>index</tt> refers to the element in the incoming set of barcode strings to be replaced with the newident string.
Typical logic is to loop through the passed-in barcode strings, identifying the abbreviated one,
changing that to the full one, then returning the index of this string (as per the convention used with
<a href="lcxh.html#setitem">setitem(&nbsp;)</a> ) along with the full string in <tt>newident</tt> </p>

<p><tt>action</tt> has to be 1 or 2 in order to tell the system to use the newident in place of the 
barcode-string at the indicated index.</p>
<p><tt>action</tt> = 1 stops further barcode-checks, <tt>action</tt> = 2 allows further barcode checks.</p>
<p>Other values of <tt>action</tt> are no-ops.</p>

<a name="section.20LCX"></a>
<h2>[LCX]</h2>
<p>This section lists parameters relevant to macrofiles.  All macrocode 
that the server uses is loaded on start or on reload-commands, and is 
used for all the various jobs, such as status-indexes, programmed reports,
make/break callbacks and so forth. During execution, clones of these are 
actually used for the various environments, thus the
<a href="lcxh.html#killfunction">killfunction( )</a> 
calls will not cause problems for other clients. </p>

<p>There is one entry, <b>FILES=</b>, which simply lists the number of files
to be prescanned and loaded. If this is changed while the server is running,
a reload-command from the client may be used to cause the updated file set
to be prescanned and used from that time on. </p>

<h3>Example:</h3>
<p><b>FILES=plcounts.lcx printsis.lcx clist.lcx sgraf.lcx itrprts.lcx bookmark.lcx itrreps.lcx pmreps.lcx </b></p>

<p>All these files are expected to be in the server's home directory. </p>

<hr/>
<a name="section.20drives"></a>
<h2>[drives]</h2>
<p>The entries in this section defines the server's numbered drives, for
path resolution. Drive <b>0:</b> is the place where the server's 
ANCHORS.DLL and this server.ini file is located. Drives <b>1:</b> 
thru <b>9:</b> may be defined to other paths relative to this, if 
so desired. Any one of drives <b>1:</b> thru <b>9:</b> 
not defined to be somewhere else will default to the server home directory.</p>

<p>The path numbers are frequently chosen to coincide with the client's, 
matching the paths specified in the <b>client.ini</b> file. </p>

<h3>Example:</h3>
<p><b>9=..<br/>
8=..\help<br/>
7=..\TXS<br/>
6=..\INI<br/>
5=..\DATA<br/>
4=..\FORMS<br/></b></p>

<p>Note that on Linux servers, the pathnames are case-sensitive,
and the slashes usually go the other way, e g.:<br/>
<b>9=..<br/>
8=../help<br/>
7=../txs</b><br/>etc</p>

<p>Either form of slash are interpreted as a directory separator.</p>

<h2>[paths]</h2>
<p>Paths used for locating certificate proformas and other details
used by LCX code on the client, the server, and CDAT. Slashes as directory
separators can be either variety.  </p>

<h3>Example:</h3>
<pre>
[paths]
chronfiles=9:\ChronFiles
REFITR1=9:\FORMS\Asheets
REFFTC1=9:\FORMS\Bsheets
AUTOPL=9:\Scanned\PL
CONPL=9:\Scanned\PL

<hr/>
<a name="section.20client"></a>
<h2>[client]</h2>
<p>This section is used to identify reference information for the master
client copy located on the server machine.  The information here is used
by the server when an Installer program wants to perform a check of 
which files have changed on the client, and asks for the master set
of files from the server. </p>

<p>There is one entry:<br/>
<b>folders=</b><br/>
which is a list of folders that are the master copies that will be 
transmitted to the clients when these are installed or updated.  The
numbered-drive naming convention is used, where the 9: identifies the root 
directory for either server or client. (parent of SYSTEM32 or SERVER)</p>

<h3>Example:</h3>
<pre>
folders=9:\ini 9:\system32 9:\prog_client
</pre>

<p>This will mark the three folders as containing the master copies of 
configuration and client executable files, to be updated to the clients. Any
configuration changes should be done here and then propagated. </p>

<hr/>
<a name="section.20systemtables"></a>
<h2>[systemtables]</h2>
<p>This section indicates what groups certain systemtables are defined under. 
This really applies in these cases where several simultaneous data-storage
mechanisms and techologies are in use.  For the time being, the only relevant
table is DDMATRIX, and this is associated with the only existing group, 
that is:</p>
<p><b>DDMATRIX=RCONN BTRS70</b></p>
<p>Of course, others may be added at some time later.</p>

<hr/>
<a name="section.20groups"></a>
<h2>[groups]</h2>
<p>This identifies the various groupings of storage methods and technologies
are actually in effect.  The actual name of the group is non-critical. </p>

<p>The entries 
refer to two names, the first one is a storage-method, the second is the
storage techology, which must have entries in the [methods] and 
[technologies] sections sections defined for them, as well as sections
with their own names defined. </p>

<p>At the moment, there are three possible groups defined <br/>
<b>WINPCS71=RCONN BTRS70</b><br/>
<b>WINPCS73=RCONN SQLI30</b><br/>
<b>WINPCS74=RCONN MSQL10</b><br/>
corresponding to the only pairs of method (RCONN) and techology. </p>


<hr/>
<a name="section.20techologies"></a>
<h2>[technologies]</h2>
<p>This section lists the supported storage-techologies. This identifies some
way of storing data in a tabular form, and extract these, at least ISAM-style.</p>

<p>For the time being, the possibilities are BTRS70, SQLI30, PSQLIO, and MSQL10, as follows:<br/>
<b>BTRS70=1 (Pervasive / Btrieve)</b><br/>
<b>SQLI30=1 (SQLite )</b><br/>
<b>PSQLIO=1 (PGSQL)</b><br/>
<b>MSQL10=1 (Microsoft SQL)</b><br/>
</p>

<hr/>
<a name="section.20methods"></a>
<h2>[methods]</h2>
<p>The entries in this section names the supported methods used for
connection objects. There is only the familiar RCONN implementation, where
everything that may be connected is specfied in the RCONN table, and
other major information is in the CXDICT table. </p>

<p><b>RCONN=1 (Network defined in RCONN and CXDICT tables)<br/> </b></p>

<hr/>
<a name="section.20techname"></a>
<h2>[ <em>(name of technology)</em> ]</h2>
<p>In these sections, various specific parameters to the named storage 
technology is specified. At the moment, BTRS70, SQLI30, PSQLIO, MSQL10 are
defined.  </p>

<p>Section BTRS70 has three entries, the data-file extension, the directory 
for server-side TXS files, and the directory for data files:</p>

<pre>
[BTRS70]
extension=DS5
TXS=0:\TXS
DATA=9:\DATA
</pre>

<p>SQLI30 has two entries, examples of typical values are shown:</p>

<pre>
[SQLI30]
extension=DB
DATA=9:\DATA
</pre>

<p>MSQL10 has one entry defined. </p>

<pre>
[MSQL10]
servicename=SQLexpress
</pre>

<p>This entry allows the system to run either with
SQL express (<b>servicename=SQLexpress</b>), or on the 
larger SQL server system whose service name is different. </p>

<p>PSQLIO has the following entries:</p>

<pre>
[PSQLIO]
host=127.0.0.1
port=5432
dbname=compde16
username=winpcs
havepassword=no
</pre>

<p>Here, the entries are: <br/>
<b>host=</b> address of the host where the postgres server runs, default 127.0.0.1<br/>
<b>port=</b> TCP port on this host where the postgres server runs, default 5432<br/>
<b>dbname=</b> Name of the database. This defaults to the project string defined in 
the Anchor files, and alternate names may be specified here. Note that this
is case-sensitive, <b>COMPDE16</b> does NOT match <b>compde16</b>.  <br/>
<b>username=</b> Name of the database user, typically <b>winpcs</b><br/>
<b>havepassword=no</b> means this user does not have a password defined<br/>
<b>havepassword=yes</b> means this user has a password defined somewhere else.<br/>
Further entries are likely to be added as necessary.</p>





<hr/>
<a name="section.20methname"></a>
<h2>[ <em>(name of method)</em> ]</h2>
<p>In these sections, various specific parameters to the named storage 
method is specified. At the moment, only RCONN has any of these, there
is a dummy entry, PLACEHOLDER=, for the others. </p>

<p>The possible entries for [RCONN] are: <b>makecontrol=</b> and
<b>breakcontrol=</b>, which should refer to a function within the files 
referenced in the [LCX] section, which are to be called whenever some 
connection is to be made or broken. These entries may be absent or blank,
in which case only the functions referenced in the RCONN table are used. </p>

<p>This is the normal arrangement. </p>

<h3>Example:</h3>
<p><b>makecontrol=MakeOK<br/>
breakcontrol=BreakOK<br/></b></p>

<hr/>
<a name="section.20offline"/>
<h2>[offline]</h2>

<p>This section indicates if the WinPCS server is running as the main server in a project, or as
a satellite server on a tablet or similar, and has to perform change-logging for subsequent updating
into the main system. </p>

<h3>offline=</h3>
<p>This is set to <b>No</b> for the main server and <b>yes</b> for the satellite server. </p>

<h3>remotechangefile=</h3>
<p>This is set to the name of the change-log file for the satellite server. It is ignored 
on the main server, which does not bother with the change-log file at all. </p.

<p>Example: <b>remotechangefile=9:\changes.txt</b></p>

<a name="server"/>
<h3>server=</h3>
<p>This entry indicates the name of the server where the WinPCS server is 
expected to be found. Alternate servers, numbered 1, 2, etc. can be identified
as SERVER1=, SERVER2= etc.  These are referred to via the 
<a href="winpcscmdline.html"> command-line argument </a> -S.  </p>

<a name="endpoint"/>
<h3>endpoint=</h3>
<p>For TCP and for DCERPC, the server is set to 
listen on some TCP port using either the WinPCS protocol or the 
ncacn_ip_tcp RPC protocol. The client must attempt to connect to the
server on the same port number.  The default values are set in ANCHORS.DLL
and ANCHORC.DLL, but if some other port number is used it can be specified 
here. </p> 
<p>Different endpoints for internal and external server addresses can be specified
as endpoint1= endpoint2= etc for the correspondingly numbered server, if
the default from anchorc.dll or the specified non-numbered endpoint= is not
the right one. </p>

<p><a href="serverini.html#options.endpoint">
A matching setting for the endpoint should be present on the server.  </a></p>

<p>The default is the port number as defined as the Endpoint 
in the ANCHORC.DLL. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.iana.org/">IANA</a> has allocated 
<a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml?search=5166">
port 5166 as available for WinPCS</a>. 
This port number is usually what is set as the default in the 
ANCHORS.DLL and ANCHORC.DLL files.  </p>

<a name="defgroup"/>
<h3>defgroup= (obsolete)</h3>
<p>This used to indicate which kind of database system is being used. 
It used to default to
RCONN BTRS70, which refers to a server running the Pervasive/Btrieve system. As we are
developing server versions for other database systems, alternate values can be specified here.</p>
<p>As of 2013-05-14, it is now obsolete and these entries will be ignored,
and may be removed from WinPCS.INI. </p>

<p>Like the <a href="#endpoint">endpoint</a> and <a href="#server">server</a> 
entries, <b>defgroup</b> can take a numerical suffix (defgroup1= defgroup2= etc) to correspond 
with the server of the same number. </p>

<a name="dynamicserver"/>
<h3>dynamicserver=</h3>
<p>There is the arrangement available when the WinPCS server does
not sit on a fixed IP address. The 
<a href="dserver.html#reachout">reachout</a> 
program runs there, and periodically updates the database within a 
<a href="dserver.html#dserver">dserver</a> 
process running on a known IP-address, with the information about the
WinPCS server's IP-address and port number. This entry indicates if this
utility, named 
<a href="dserver.html#rqcli ">rqcli</a>, 
is to be used to determine the server address. <b>dynamicserver=off</b>
is the usual case where the WinPCS server is at a known IP address, and
some string along the lines of <b>dynamicserver=proj 1.2.3.4:56789</b> is used
to specify that the dynamical IP address server is located at the specified
IP-address (example here is 1.2.3.4) and port number (example 56789). </p>

<a name="servertxt"/>
<h3>servertxt=</h3>
<p>For the benefit of users of the Installer, each server identified as
server= server1= server2= etc., can be named with servertxt= servertxt1= 
servertxt2= etc., so that the user of the Installer can get a list of 
understandable descriptions.</p>

<a name="proxy"/>
<h3>proxy=</h3>
<p>Some systems may be distributed where there is a proxy server in use.</p>
<p>This setting determines if a proxy is to be used or not. There are three
options: </p>
<p><b>proxy=no</b> Do not use a proxy server, even if one might be present and
being discovered. </p>
<p><b>proxy=auto</b>Determine if there is a proxy server available, and use
it if one is found. This is the default behavior.</p>

<p><b>proxy=ipaddress:port</b>Use the proxy with this IP address and 
port-number. Don't depend on other proxies that might be present.</p>

<p>Like the <b>auth=</b>, <b>servertxt=</b>, and <b>endpoint=</b> entries, there 
can be set one <b>proxy1=</b> <b>proxy2=</b> etc., differently for each server. 
The default will be the unnumbered <b>proxy=</b> 
entry for the ones that are not specified otherwise.</p>

<a name="heartbeat"/>
<h3>heartbeat=</h3>
<a name="heartbeat_ival_proxy"/>
<h3>heartbeat_ival_proxy=</h3>
<a name="heartbeat_ival_direct"/>
<h3>heartbeat_ival_direct=</h3>

<p>On some systems, to have the TCP connection stay open, it may need to be
refreshed with some period. To turn this mechanism on, set <b>heartbeat=on</b>,
to leave it off set <b>heartbeat=off</b>. The default is <b>on</b>. Turning it
off is considered experimental, and does not always work all that well.</p>

<p>The values for the <b>heartbeat_ival_...=</b> entries 
are period times in seconds here. 
Depending on whether proxies are found, the period can be set 
differently. The default for the <b>heartbeat_ival_proxy=</b>
is 10 seconds, and the default for the <b>heartbeat_ival_direct=</b>
is 20 seconds. Generally, low values such as 10 or 20 s are useful on 
on long-haul connections, while <b>heartbeat_ival_direct=</b> periods 
as long as 3600 seconds may be useful on LANs. </p>

<a name="auth"/>
<h3>auth=</h3>
<p>This and its matching entry on the server-side server.INI file there 
controls authentication of the RPC calls. For Windows XP SP 2 these must
be turned on for both server and client, for other variants of Windows
they may be turned off. Set <b>auth=on</b> or <b>auth=off</b> accordingly. </p>

<p>The setting on the server is generally supposed to be the same. 
It is also possible to have different 
settings on the various servers, for this, we can use <b>auth1=</b>,
<b>auth2=</b> and so on, for the corresponding <b>server1=</b>, 
<b>server2=</b> etc. See the 
<a href="trouble.html"> discussion under errors 5 and 1747 </a>.  </p>

<p>This <b>auth=</b> setting is only used with DCERPC systems. TCP systems
ignore it.</p>

<a name="speedtest"></a>
<h3>speedtest_interval_ms=</h3>
<p>How frequent are speed-tests to be made, in milliseconds.
Default 0, this means there are no speed tests being run.  </p>

<h3>speedtest_latest=</h3>
<p>Small file to put the latest speed-test result into.
This will be overwritten continually.  Default is no file.</p>

<h3>speedtest_logfile=</h3>
<p>Log-file to put all the speed-test result into.  Default is no file.</p>

<a name="iolog"></a>
<h3>iolog=</h3>
<p>Specifies a log-file, where the information between the client and server
is shown. Useful for optimisations, but this file will grow.</p>

<a name="interval"/>
<h3>interval=</h3>
<p>This entry indicates the interval of checking the server presence and 
any messages it may have. The value given is in milliseconds. A typical
value is 300000 milliseconds, or 300 seconds, that is, 5 minutes. </p>

<a name="periodfiles"/>
<h3>periodfiles=</h3>
<p>This lists the files to find the
<a href="#periodcall">periodcall</a> 
function in. If this is missing or blank, the function will be expected to be
in one of the files listed in the
<a href="#library">library</a> 
entry instead. </p>

<a name="periodcall"/>
<h3>periodcall=</h3>
<p>This is the name of a periodically called function, called at every 
<a href="#interval">INTERVAL</a> 
milliseconds. Its main purpose is to look for any messages for the user. 
If this entry is missing or refers to a blank function, nothing will be done.  </p>

<a name="rightmenu"/>
<h3>rightmenu=</h3>
<p>This indicates where the main source of the right-click menu entries in the
hierarchies are. When set to <b>rightmenu=DDMATRIX</b>, 
the values in the field MENU_TXT in the DDMATRIX table are
used, not the ones defined on the Strip. </p>

<a name="lockout"/>
<h3>lockout=</h3>
<p>This can be used to temporarily stop users from logging in, 
or allow them to log in but after having been shown a message.  </p>
<p><tt><b>lockout=0</b></tt><br/> means the system is open and no message is 
to be shown. This is the default.</p>
<p><tt><b>lockout=1</b> <em>message</em></tt><br/> means the system is closed, 
and the message should explain why. </p>
<p><tt><b>lockout=5</b> <em>message</em></tt><br/> means the system is open, 
but there is some important message that should be shown.</p>

<a name="editor"/>
<h3>editor=</h3>
<p>Selects the text editor program that WinPCS invokes for editing INI 
and other text files.  A typical value here would be <b>editor=notepad.exe</b>
but other editors such as vim, ultraedit or textpad might be preferred. </p>

<a name="ddesvc"/>
<h3>ddesvc=</h3>
<p>List the names of recognizeable DDE servers that WinPCS may recognize. 
There are also a need for a section for each of these programs.
See the <a href="#section.20DDEservers"> DDE-servers sections </a> info below.</p>

<a name="library"/>
<h3>library=</h3>
<p>Some globally loaded macrofunctions can be specified here in files. </p>

<a name="appearance"/>
<h3>appearance=</h3>
<p>This entry allows changing the appearance of View, 
Entry, and Inspect screens, and the Report windows. </p>
<p>Set to <b>exp1</b> for a moderately changed color scheme and <b>new</b> for
a more radically different color scheme. Other values will give the old 
traditional look.</p>

<a name="transferblock"/>
<h3>transferblock=</h3>
<p>This entry defines the size of each data block used when transferring
files to or from the server. Default value is 16384. Larger values make
for better overall transfer speeds at the expense of less interactivity.
On long-haul networks, where the latency is long, larger values such as
1048576 is preferrable. Powers of 2 are recommended but not mandatory.  
</p>

<a name="onstart"/>
<a name="startfiles"/>
<h3>onstart= and startfiles=</h3>
<p>The onstart= defines an LCX function that is to be run when WinPCS 
is started. It is expected to be in one of the files listed in 
startfiles=. In addition to functions there, the functions in the
<a href="#library ">library files</a> will also be available.</p>


<hr/>
<a name="debug"/>
<h3>debug=</h3>
<p>This indicates whether serial-port or other debug-tracing is turned on 
or off. Values specify somewhere to go for the debugging output as well as 
<a href="lcxh.html#trace">trace( )</a> function calls from LCX code. These 
can be:</p>
<pre>
<b>Debug=OFF</b>
<b>Debug=COM</b><em>n</em>
<b>Debug=net</b><em> ipaddress</em>
<b>Debug=net</b><em> ipaddress</em><b>:</b><em>port</em>
<b>Debug=udp</b><em> ipaddress</em>
<b>Debug=udp</b><em> ipaddress</em><b>:</b><em>port</em>
<b>Debug=file</b><em> filename</em>
</pre>

<p>See also the discussions on the 
<a href="lcxh.html#CWULIB">CWULIB( ) function</a>  and 
<a href="lcxh.html#AimDebugOutput">AimDebugOutput( ) function</a>. </p>

<p> The <b>net</b> and <b>udp</b> options allow <a href="netdebug.html"> 
sending messages through a network </a>. The default when no 
port is specified is 16385.</p>

<p>The COM<em>n</em> options select the numbered serial port.</p>

<p>The <b>file</b> puts the output into the named file, which 
will end up in the system32 or server directory.</p>

<a name="cdatdebug"/>
<h3>cdatdebug=</h3>
<p>When running the Transfer phase of CDAT, some functions in WinPCS are
invoked, and if desired, the debugging-output can be turned on for this.
as well, running in a separate channel from the <a href="#debug">main 
client debugging output described above.</a></p>

<p>The default is off, meaning no trace messages occur, and the various
possible settings are the same as listed above for the
<a href="#debug">debug= </a> entry.</p>

<p>Note that any calls to the LCX function 
<a href="lcxh.html#trace">trace( )</a> 
from the CDAT-set callback
functions will appear in this channel, not in any main client 
channel. </p>

<a name="pdfcertclientdebug"/>
<h3>pdfcert_client_debug=</h3>
<p>This controls debug-output for the PDFCert client interface (CPDCLI.DLL).
The possible settings are the same as listed above for the
<a href="#debug">debug= </a> entry. The default is <b>off</b> for no output.
</p>

<hr/>
<a name="section.20Menu"/>
<h2>[MENU]</h2>
<p>The entries in this section indicate the presence or absence of certain
menu items.  Each of the entries may have the PRESENT or ABSENT value.</p>

<p>The entries are:
<b>STDREP=</b><br/>
<b>STDIMP=</b><br/>
<b>EDITMENU=</b><br/>
<b>RUNMENU=</b><br/></p>

<hr/>
<a name="section.20Strip"/>
<h2>[STRIP]</h2>
<p>The entries here identify the items in the Strip, the row of icons at the
bottom of the screen.  The entries here have one of the forms:</p>
<pre><em>name</em><b>=L </b><em>posn</em> <b>(</b><em>menutext</em><b>)</b> <b>(</b><em>explanation</em><b>)</b> </pre>
<pre><em>name</em><b>=R </b><em>posn</em> <b>(</b><em>menutext</em><b>)</b> <b>(</b><em>explanation</em><b>)</b> </pre>
<p>The <em>name</em> is the name of the symbol, defined in REFBMP31.INI and referenced
as a drop-target fieldname in DDMATRIX.  </p>

<p><b>L</b> and <b>R</b> indicates if the icon is 
to be placed to the left or the right, and <em>posn</em> is the positioning from 
this side, where 0 is at the end.</p>

<p><em>menutext</em> is the text that is to appear in the menu entries in the right-click
menus in the hierarchies. If this is blank, this will not be included in these menus.</p>

<p><em>explanation</em> is the text that will be shown as tool-tips
on the main WinPCS screen, when the pointer is moved over one of the icons in the Strip.
If this is blank, just with the empty pair of parentheses or entirely absent, there will 
be no tool-tips shown.  </p>

<hr/>
<a name="section.20Paths"/>
<h2>[PATHS]</h2>
<p>Entries here are references to paths in various DLL and LCX files. 
Left side is some key value, right side is the path, which may be using
the numbered drives. </p>

<p>Note that the numbered drives themselves are defined in the 
<a href="clientini.html"> CLIENT.INI</a>
file, not in WinPCS.INI. </p>

</p>

<hr/>
<a name="section.20Synfare"/>
<h2>[SYNFARE]</h2>
<p>There are 2 entries here, QUOTE= and SEPARATOR= and they refer to the
characters to be used for quote and field separators in SYNFARE CSV files.
Record separators are always new-lines.
</p>

<hr/>
<a name="section.20Ppview"/>
<h2>[PPVIEW]</h2>
<p>The entries here are WRAPWIDTH and STARTWIDTH </p>

<p>WRAPWIDTH indicates how wide a column in a report
may be before it defaults to a multiline layout.  Applies to default report
formatting. Typical value is WRAPWIDTH=60
</p>

<p>STARTWIDTH determines how large the window should be when it opens. The 
value is the width of the window in percent of the screen horizontal 
area; about 80 looks good. This also changes the behavior of the landscape
mode previews to extende fully horizontal instead of vertical. </p>
<p>A typical value thus is STARTWIDTH=80.</p>

<hr/>
<a name="section.20Hier"/>
<h2>[HIER]</h2>
<p>There can be three entries here, HIERWIDTH, SPACEMODE, and CASCADE</p>
<p>The entry HIERWIDTH indicates how wide 
the Hierarchy views are when they open. The value is in percentage
of screen width. A typical value is 60 for 60% of the screen.  
</p>
<p>SPACEMODE can be 0, 1, or 2:</p>
<table border="1">
<tr><td>SPACEMODE</td><td>Description</td> </tr>
<tr><td>0</td><td>Strings in the hierarchies are shown with a single 
space character between the tag number and description. 
This is the default.</td> </tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>Strings in the hierarchies are shown with a
bit of space between the tag number and description. The amount of space
varies slightly.</td> </tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Strings in the hierarches have the description part
moved to the right, and all objects on the same level are indented the
same amount, depending on the widest tag-number string. Subsequent levels
are always indented further, even though the tag numbers here might not
be that long.</td> </tr>
</table>
<p>CASCADE indicates if the hierarchies cascade down the same as Views
and Reports do. Set to 1 to enable this, set to 0 to retain the old
full-height at top behavior. </p>

<hr/>
<a name="section.20View"/>
<h2>[VIEW]</h2>
<p>There can be two entries here, WIDTH and ASPECT</p>

<p>The entry WIDTH, similar to HIERWIDTH for Hierarchies, indicates 
how wide the View windows are when they open. The value is in percentage
of screen width. A typical value is 40 for 40% of the screen.  
</p>

<p>ASPECT indicates how tall the window is compared to the width. 
The number is a percentage, 100 makes a regular rectangular window, 
160 makes it approximately square, 200 makes it tall.</p>

<p>These apply to View, Entry, and Inspect windows.</p>

<hr/>
<a name="section.20Report"/>

<h2>[REPORT]</h2>

<h3>FRAMEFILE= FRAMEFUNCTION= ORIENT=</h3>

<p>The entries FRAMEFILE= and FRAMEFUNCTION= identifies the default report 
formatting function and the file where this function can be found.  
Orientation is set via ORIENT=, this is 0 for Portrait, 1 for Landscape,
and 9 for asking the user for the one or the other. </p>

<h3>STDTITLE= PRINTTITLE= SHORTTITLE= </h3>

<p>STDTITLE= PRINTTITLE= SHORTTITLE= are titles to be shown 
on various reports.</p>

<h3>SIERRMSG=</h3>

<p>Entry SIERRMSG= controls if error-messages from bad tree-lines and other
reasons for failure to run SI reports should appear as messages. </p>

<p>SIERRMSG=0 turns the message-box off.</p>
<p>SIERRMSG=1 turns the message-box on.</p>

<h3>SICOUNT=</h3>

<p>SICOUNT= defines the number of fields to pass for each iteration of
status index reports. The default (whis is used by the
<a href="siclient.html">siclient</a> 
utility) is 2000. Lower values cause more frequent
updates of the Odometer Window, but more passes on the network. Higher
values cause less frequent, larger, amounts of data and a less frequent
update rate. </p>

<h3>PRLIST_INFO= PRLIST_FUNCTION=</h3>

<p>PRLIST_INFO= sets the information text for the Print Certificates
pushbutton in the Standard or Quick Reports.</p>

<p>PRLIST_FUNCTION= sets the name of the LCX function that is
to perform this certificate printing. 
<a href="call3217.html"> This function </a> is similar to
but not identical to the <a href="call0013.html"> FORALL2</a>
functions available in STAREP.INI. 
The files where this function is to be located should be listed in the
<a href="clientini.html#PRLIST">entry PRLIST= under section [LCX] in 
client.ini</a>. </p>

<h3>TEMPFILES=</h3>

<p>TEMPFILES= sets the location where the temporary file which is used for
transferring to Excel is to be written. The argument is some path, either a
complete system path, or a "numbered-drives" path. If this entry is missing
or blank, the default temporary file location that is set in the operating
system will be used. </p>

<h3>ADDBLANK=</h3>

<p>ADDBLANK=yes will make the empty reports show with a record and the text
"No records found" in the first column.</p>

<p>ADDBLANK=no will cause empty reports to not be shown at all. </p>

<a name="reportpdfoutput"/>
<h3>PDFOUTPUT=</h3>

<p>PDFOUTPUT= sets where the saved PDF files from immediate printing of reports
are to go. Default is <b>9:\reportpdfs</b> 
Numerical paths are used here, as there is an internal call 
to the equivalent of <a href="lcxh.html#ExpandPath">ExpandPath( )</a>.  </p>

<p>See also: <a href="call3217.html">Quick Report Print List Functions</a></p>

<hr/>
<a name="section.20Rconn"/>
<h2>[RCONN]</h2>
<p>files= is for the client-side make and break activities functions.</p>

<p>stadlg= are files with status-dialog functions in them. These are also
referenced for 
<a href="serverini.html#section.20cdat.barcodediscovery"> CDAT's barcodediscovery= function </a> </p>

<hr/>
<a name="section.20Hiertop"/>
<h2>[HIERTOP]</h2>
<p>Entries here give parameters for various hierarchies. They are on one of the the forms:</p>

<pre>
<em>table</em><b>=(</b><em>Title</em><b>)</b> <em>tail-arguments</em>
<em>phase table</em><b>=(</b><em>Title</em><b>)</b> <em>tail-arguments</em>
</pre>

<p>The optional <em>phase</em> can allow hierarchies off the same level to display
and act differently on subordinate items, by adjusting the tail-arguments accordingly. </p>

<p>The tail-arguments are a sequence of space-separated arguments, each one can be one of these:</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="2"> <tbody>

<p>There is one of these for each of the servers listed in the

<a href="#ddesvc">ddesvc entry</a>. In addition, for EXCEL, the following
extra options exist:</p>

<pre>
[EXCEL]
ROWLETTER=R
COLLETTER=C
</pre>

<p>Here standard Excel idenfies cells as <b>R</b><em>rowno</em><b>C</b><em>colno</em>, but other language versions are known
to have different letters. German uses Z and S, Portuguese has F and C, and Polish apparently use W and K. To allow use with
different languages, the various alternate sets can be listed here, as for example:</p> 

<pre>
ROWLETTER=RZFW
COLLETTER=CSCK
</pre>

<p>Now these can be R and C, Z and S, F and C, or W and K. </p>

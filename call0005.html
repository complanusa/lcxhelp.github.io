<h1>Drag and Drop Actions -- Category 5</h1>

<h3>Enabling controls in WinPCS:</h3>

<p>Function calls in this category are made when an item is picked up from 
a <a href="evini.html#DDSERV"> $DDSERV( ) </a> field in a View, a Hierarchy, or a View Connections list; 
and then dropped on another <a href="evini.html#DDSERV"> $DDSERV( ) </a> field 
in some other View, another VCONN list, 
another Hierarchy, or one of the enabled on-screen WinPCS drop-client icons. The DDMATRIX table 
is consulted and if a matching record is found there, the function referred to is called. This 
function may also be called in response to a right-button click on some object in a hierarchy.</p>

<p>In 16-bit systems, the response to an external DDE-Execute as 
described in <a href="dde.html#WinPCS.20as.20a.20DDE.20server"> 
WinPCS as a DDE server </a> also uses this category,
but the discussion of these is better deferred to that section. </p>

<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>Drag-Drop operations are controlled by the DDMATRIX records.
Two special cases exist, both involving View Connections Lists.</p>

<p>1. The behavior of the Trash-can is standardized: dropping some object from a VCONN 
list invokes a Break operation between the object dropped in the can and the object seen
in the View. In this case, the 
<a href="call3204.html"> 
Break-connection </a>
function will be called, not the one in DDMATRIX.</p>

<p>2. Dropping anything into a View Connections (VCONN) list causes the 
system to attempt to make the connection between that object and the 
object shown in the View.  In this process, it will call the 
<a href="call3204.html"> 
Make-connection </a>function. If the connection attempt is successful, 
the freshly made connection will be shown. (TBC!)</p>

<p>Dropping objects from Views' <a href="evini.html#DDSERV"> $DDSERV( ) </a>or any Hierarchy 
onto the Trashcan will cause a normal DDMATRIX lookup. Dropping objects 
from a VCONN list to anywhere else except another VCONN List or the 
Trashcan will also cause a normal DDMATRIX lookup.  Thus, except for 
the two cases mentioned above, drag-drop generally is controlled by 
entries in DDMATRIX, identifying origin, target, and LCX file and 
macro function to run.  The field FILE identifies one or more LCX files 
and the field WFUNCTION identifies the function to execute. This one must 
be present in one of the files listed, but not necessarily the first one. </p>

<h3>Disallowed functions:</h3>
<p>DDE callback and document-drawing functions are only available inside 
the DDE callback and Printing callback environments.  There is however 
no restrictions on initiating printing or DDE-operations.</p>

<h3>LCX files:</h3>
<p>Paths are to be given in the FILE field in the relevant record of 
DDMATRIX. More than one file may be specified here.</p>

<h3>Callback functions (32-bit):</h3>
<p>The field WFUNCTION (or FUNCTION on some older non-SQL-based systems) in DDMATRIX identifies 
the LCX function to execute. 
This one must be present in one of the files listed in the FILE field, 
(or in the client-side library of pre-loaded files, in winpcs.ini section [WINPCS] entry LIBRARY=)
but does not necessarily have to be the first one.  The return value 
of this callback function is used to indicate the need for refreshing the
hierarchy view. The functions are invoked as:</p>

<pre><em>updateinfo</em><b> = </b><em>function</em><b>(</b><em>This_group</em><b>, </b><em>This_type</em><b>, </b><em>This_icon</em><b>, </b><em>This_name</em><b>,
	</b><em>Target_group</em><b>, </b><em>Target_type</em><b>, </b><em>Target_icon</em><b>, </b><em>Target_name</em><b>, 
	</b><em>origin</em><b>, </b><em>hierinfo</em><b>)</b></pre>

<p>The <em>This_...</em> arguments refer to the object being dragged, 
and the <em>Target_...</em> arguments refer to the location or object 
it was dropped on. The <em>origin</em> indicates whether the 
dragged object came from a View, VCONN, or Hierarchy, and the 
<em>hierinfo</em> contains available information about connected objects. </p>

<p>For the time being, the <em>..._group</em> arguments contain no 
useful info and may be ignored. </p>

<p>The <em>This_type</em> arguments contains the table name of the 
object, <em>This_icon</em> is the icon-name and 
<em>This_name</em> is the item-identity of the object, as can be 
found in the field returned by
<a href="lcxh.html#StdField">StdField(<em>This_type</em>, "ITEMFLD")</a> </p>

<p>The <em>Target_type</em>, <em>Target_icon</em>, and 
<em>Target_name</em> similarly identifies
the target being dropped on or the object being dropped on. </p>

<p><em>origin</em> is one of:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>VCONN</b> for objects dragged out of a VCONN list</li>
<li><b>HSVCONN</b> for objects dragged out of a Hierarchy</li>
<li><b>EVIEW</b> for objects dragged out of a View <a href="evini.html#DDSERV"> $DDSERV( ) </a></li>
</ul>

<p><em>hierinfo</em> is a set of objects which are connected on higher 
levels. Each object is defined within a 2-part subset, 
<em>type+name+</em>, or <em>tablename+itemname+</em>.</p>

<ul>
<li>for <em>origin</em>==<b>VCONN</b> this is a 4-part set giving the object in the View followed by the one picked up from VCONN</li>
<li>for <em>origin</em>==<b>HSVCONN</b> this is a 2<em>n</em>-part set giving all the <em>n</em> parent objects in the Hierarchy</li>
<li>for <em>origin</em>==<b>EVIEW</b> this is a 2-part set giving the 
identity of the object</li>
</ul>

<p>In all cases, the last 2 elements of the set will be the same as the 
values of the arguments <em>This_type</em> and <em>This_name</em>.</p>

<h3>Return Value (32-bit) </h3>
<p>The function should return a value or a set, identified as <em>updateinfo</em>, where 
the value or first element in the set indicates what is to happen in the hierarchy when 
the item is dropped on or dragged out and the right-click-menu selection function 
is performed:</p>
<ul>
<li>0 = Don't refresh the hierarchy. </li>
<li>1 = Refresh the appearance of the item. Typical case is when changing status of preservation items or check-sheets. </li>
<li>2 = Close and re-open the item. Typical use of this is creation of punch-items.</li>
<li>3 = Close and re-open the parent of the item. Typical case is changing status of punch-items 
that may affect the appearance of the parent and sibling objects.</li>
<li>4 = Close and re-open the entire hierarchy. Typical case is when 
preservation schedule has to change. </li> 
</ul>


<h3>No Positioning of tables. (32-bit) </h3>
<p>There are no specific current records defined in any tables, such 
records must be established through calls to functions such as 
<a href="lcxh.html#findexact">findexact( )</a> 
or <a href="lcxh.html#finddual">finddual( )</a>.  For example:</p>

<pre> SomeAction(string group, string table, string icon, string itemid, 
	string Tgroup, string Ttable, string Ticon, string Titemid, 
	string wherefrom, string hierinfo)
{
	string hlen, Ptable, Pitem;

	if("VCONN" == wherefrom || "HSVCONN" == wherefrom)
	{
		hlen = setlen(hierinfo);
		Ptable = setitem(hierinfo, hlen-4);
		Pitem = setitem(hierinfo, hlen-3);

		finddual(Ptable, table, StdField(table, "ITEMFLD"), itemid, StdField(Ptable, "ITEMFLD"), Pitem);

		/* Do what may be done in Hierarchies or VCONNs. The current records of these 4 tables will be set right:
			"RCONN"
			table
			Ptable
			get("RCONN", "CONBASE");
		 */
	}
	else
	{
		findexact(table, StdField(table, "ITEMFLD"), itemid);
		/* Do whatever can be be done when there are no additional connections defined.  */
	}
	/* Return value to indicate updating in hierarchies: 0 is none, 
		1 is refresh the appearance of the item itself, 
		2 is close and re-open the item 
		3 is close and re-open the item's parent and the item */ 
	return(makeset(1, "tbd") );
}
</pre>

<p>This will establish the record of the item's table, and when possible 
(that is for VCONN or HSVCONN), the table of 
its parent item, the connection table between them, and RCONN. </p>

<h3>Callback functions (16-bit):</h3>
<p>The DDMATRIX field FUNCTION identifies the function to execute. 
This one must be present in one of the files listed in the FILE 
field, but does not necessarily have to be the first 
one.  The return value of the callback function is not used for 
anything. The callback functions are invoked as:</p>

<pre>example_function(frombase, fromfield, tobase, tofield, 
            bmpinfo, orginfo, iteminfo, wherefrom, hierinfo) </pre>

<p>The <em>frombase</em> and <em>fromfield</em> are the table and 
field where the item dragged originates and the <em>tobase</em> 
and <em>tofield</em> is where it is dropped. 
Note that by themselves these do not identify the item itself, 
only its beginning and ending positions. 
The name of the bitmap representing the object is available in 
the <em>bmpinfo</em>. </p>

<p><em>orginfo</em> indicates the current value of the originating 
field, and similarly, the <em>iteminfo</em>
indicates the nature of the item. These two arguments appear as 
three-part sets, where part 1 
(<a href="lcxh.html#setitem"> setitem(<em>info</em>, 0)</a>) 
is the name of the base, part 2 
(<a href="lcxh.html#setitem"> setitem(<em>info</em>, 1)</a>) 
is the fieldname, and part 3 
(<a href="lcxh.html#setitem"> setitem(<em>info</em>, 2)</a>) 
is the value of this fieldname in the record corresponding to 
the item being dragged.</p>

<p><em>orginfo</em> contains the fieldname of the originating 
<a href="evini.html#DDSERV"> $DDSERV( ) </a> field, for drags from a View. Drags from a connection 
list have the RCONN ITEMFLD values here instead.</p>

<p>The more useful one is the <em>iteminfo</em>. It contains 
the entire information necessary to locate the item in the base. 
The first two parts are the same as <em>frombase</em> and 
<em>fromfield</em>; and the  third part is the unique identifying 
value.  Though the <em>item</em> is present in the Views and 
Connect lists, there may also have been other 
movements, that cause the current record to have changed. 
The callback function ought therefore to begin as shown in the following 
example <b>SomeItem()</b> function:</p>

<pre> SomeItem(string frombase, string fromfield, string tobase, 
    string tofield, string bitmapid, string itemID, 
    string originID, string wherefrom, string hierinfo)
{
    string item;

    item = setitem (originID, 2);
    findexact (frombase, fromfield, item);
    /* Operate on current record of frombase, this is the
        item having been dropped.... */
    return (0);
}
</pre>

<p>The argument <em>wherefrom</em>indicates where the dragged object came from. 
This is <b>EVIEW5</b> if it came from a <a href="evini.html#DDSERV"> $DDSERV( ) </a> location 
and <b>VCONN</b> for things originating in a VCONN list, 
and <b>HSVCONN</b> if the origin was a hierarchy.</p>

<p>The argument <em>hierinfo</em> contains information from 
the hierarchy, similar to that argument of the same name 
in the 32-bit systems. </p>

<h3>Positioning of tables. (16-bit) </h3>
<p>For all of them: The table where an object lives is positioned on the record 
corresponding to the object.  For VCONN-origin, the table being Viewed 
is positioned on the object being viewed, and RCONN is positioned on  
the record where ITEMBASE is in the View and RELBASE is 
the home table of the dragged object.  For Hierarchy-origin drags, 
all tables shown in the tree rising up from the object being dragged 
are positioned on the objects which are the ancestors of the dragged 
object.  RCONN is positioned on  the record where ITEMBASE is the 
parent of the object as seen in the Hierarchy and RELBASE is the home 
table of the dragged object. If the object dragged is from the top of 
the hierarchy, the ITEMBASE field of the RCONN record is blank, but 
RELBASE is still the table of the object dragged.</p>

<h3>Special replacements:</h3>
<p>None. If the function is non-existent a configuration error 
message will appear in its place. If there is no DDMATRIX definition 
for a particular drag-drop, no action will occur. </p>

<h3>Execution context:</h3>
<p>Not shared and not re-entered.</p>

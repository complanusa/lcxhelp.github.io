<h1>Get and Set Status -- Category 1</h1>

<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>The functions in this category are called when a status on some item is to be examined.  
The actual call takes place as part of status evaluation initiated by double-clicking the 
icon in the View Connection list or the hierarchy; via the 
<a href="lcxh.html#statusdialog">statusdialog( )</a>
function call, or via a drag-drop action in a status index.</p>

<p>The <b>Get( )</b> call is made immediately before the defined status is to be used in a status-
addition operation, and the <b>Set( )</b> function is called immediately before the Update 
operation on the status-carrying table, thereby committing its value.</p>

<h3>Enabling control in WinPCS:</h3>
<p><b>get=</b> and <b>set=</b> entries in STADLG.INI, for a dialog-definition referred to in 
<b>STATREES.INI</b>, in the <b>[$SINGLE]</b> section there for various status-carriers.</p>

<h3>Disallowed functions:</h3>
<p>DDE callback and document-drawing functions are only available inside the DDE 
callback and Printing callback environments.  There is however no restrictions on 
initiating printing or DDE-operations. It is possible to appropriate the
<b>Get( )</b> function and have it become the 
action-function for a doubleclick action in a hierarchy.  In these cases, the corresponding 
dialog has no dialog spec (<b>SHOWDIALOG=DISALLOW</b>), no information-fields and 
the <b>Set( )</b> function should be <b>NOOP</b>.</p>

<h3>LCX files:</h3>
<p>LCX files holding Get and Set functions are to be listed in <b>WINPCS.INI</b>, section 
<b>[RCONN]</b>, entry <b>stadlg=</b><em>files ... </em></p>

<h3>Callback functions:</h3>
<pre><em>get_function</em><b>(</b><em>refbase</em><b>, </b><em>reffld</em><b>, </b><em>refuni</em><b>, </b><em>refdes</em><b>, 
        </b><em>connbase</em><b>, </b><em>xkeyval</em><b>, </b><em>xdata</em><b>, </b><em>catflag</em><b>, 
        </b><em>wherefrom</em><b>, </b><em>itembase</em><b>, </b><em>itemID</em><b>, </b><em>carrier</em><b>,
        </b><em>reportID</em><b>, </b><em>row</em><b>, </b><em>column</em><b>, </b><em>hierinfo</em><b>)</b>

<em>opcode</em><b> = </b><em>set_function</em><b>(</b><em>refbase</em><b>, </b><em>reffld</em><b>, </b><em>refuni</em><b>, </b><em>refdes</em><b>, 
        </b><em>connbase</em><b>, </b><em>xkeyval</em><b>, </b><em>xdata</em><b>, </b><em>catflag</em><b>, 
        </b><em>wherefrom</em><b>, </b><em>itembase</em><b>, </b><em>itemID</em><b>, </b><em>carrier</em><b>,

</pre>

<p>Here, <br/>
<em>refbase</em> is the name of the leaf-table where the status inspection takes place. This is the 
table name as given in <b>STATREES.INI</b> in the <b>[$SINGLE]</b> section. </p>

<p><em>reffld</em> is the field of the <em>refbase</em> holding the identity, typically a certificate number.
This is the same value as the <b>RELITEMFLD/ITEMFLD</b> in <b>RCONN</b>, or <b>ITEMFLD</b> in <b>CXDICT</b>, as will be 
returned using <a href="lcxh.html#StdField"> StdField</a><b>(</b><em>refbase</em><b>, "ITEMFLD")</b>. </p>

<p><em>refuni</em> is the value of the above field for this instance of the certificate or whatever.</p>

<p><em>refdes</em> is the title or description of the certificate or other object, as would be found in the 
standard description field.</p>

<p><em>connbase</em> is the connection table. Always, even if the actual status carrier is the leaf. The </p>
<p><em>carrier</em> argument below refers to this table.</p>

<p><em>xkeyval</em> is the name of the key field used to look up the proper record in the carrier table.</p>

<p><em>xdata</em> is the name of the field carrying the status value.  This field is in the carrier table.</p>

<p><em>catflag</em> is the flag from the <b>STATREES.INI [$SINGLE]</b> section that indicates the relationship 
between  status-carrying table (or instance table) and connection table. A value of 1 or -1 indicates that the 
connection-table is the instance table, a value of 0 indicates the status is held in the leaf-table instead. 
See the information on Bound and Unbound status for more on this.</p>

<p><em>wherefrom</em> identifies the origin of the call whether it was done from a Status Index, a 
View Connections, a hierarchy or a macrofunction calling <a href="lcxh.html#statusdialog">statusdialog( )</a>.</p>

<p><em>itembase</em> is the table and itemID which identifies the object the certificate is connected to. Use the 
<a href="lcxh.html#StdField">StdField( )</a> function to find other important fields of the itembase table.</p>

<p><em>carrier</em> is the table wherein the status value lives. This is sometimes referred to as an Instance table, and
the the records within are Instances which hold the status value.  The previous arguments <em>xkeyval</em> and 
<em>xdata</em> refer to fields in this table.</p>

<p><em>reportID</em>, <em>row</em>, and <em>column</em> are only defined when the <b>Get( )</b> and <b>Set( )</b> 
functions are called through a mass-clearing operation in a status Index. The <em>reportID</em> may be used with 
<a href="lcxh.html#RepGet">RepGet( )</a> , <a href="lcxh.html#RepPut">RepPut( )</a>, and the rest of the RepXXX( ) family of functions
to read and write information in the report. <em>row</em> and <em>column</em> identify the row and column at which the 
status-setting takes place in a form suitable for use with 
<a href="lcxh.html#RepGet">RepGet( <em>row</em>, <em>column</em>, <em>Report</em> )</a>.</p>

<p><em>hierinfo</em> is a list of higher-level tables in hierarchies. This may be just the two levels on status
dialogs started from VCONN lists. Each level in the hierarchy is identified by table-name and identity (tag
number or similar) in a 2-part set.
</p>

<h3>Current Records:</h3>
<p>The 3 tables referred to in the arguments <em>refbase</em>, <em>connbase</em>, <em>itembase</em>, and 
<em>carrier</em> are all open and positioned on the records corresponding to the object being read and set status on
and the record in the status-carrying table where this is stored. Note that the <em>carrier</em> may be the same 
as either refbase or connbase, as indicated by the <em>catflag</em>. 
</p>

<h3>Return Value for the Set status function:</h3>
<p><b>0</b> for OK and update status, <br/>
<b>-1</b> for do not update status, possibly because the <b>Set( )</b> function has done it already, anyways keep quiet about it.<br/>
<b>-2</b> for fail with a standard message. <br/>
Old status is retained if the values <b>-1</b> or <b>-2</b> are returned unless updates have taken place in the <b>Set( )</b> function. 
Other return values are not defined.
</p>

<h3>Special replacements (all systems):</h3>
<p><b>NOOP</b> which means that no function is called, no variables are set up and no status change will take place.
</p>

<h3>Special replacements (16-bit only):</h3>
<p><b>DISALLOW</b>
</p>

<h3>Execution context:</h3>
<p>The <b>Get( )</b> function is the first one called during status examinations. The execution 
context of the <b>Get( )</b>, <b>Set( )</b>, 
<a href="call0003.html"> Info Init </a>,
and in 16-bit systems, 
<a href="call1602.html"> Add status</a>
are shared, so that global variables can have values set in the <b>Get( )</b> callback, and these are 
remembered during the subsequent <b>Set( )</b>,  
<a href="call0003.html"> Info Init </a>, and
<a href="call1602.html"> Add status</a> calls.

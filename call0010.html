<h1>Print Preview, Documents, and Reports -- Category 10</h1> 

<p> Function calls in this category are made<br/>
1. When a document or certificate is  executed via the 
<a href="lcxh.html#unicert">unicert( )</a> or, on 16-bit systems, also the
<a href="lcxh.html#unicert">printcert( )</a> or 
<a href="lcxh.html#unicert">certificate( )</a> functions.<br/>
2. When a Report (Status Index, Quantitative Report, Programmed Report, SYNFARE View, or Standard Report)
is being Printed or previewed.</p>

<h3>Enabling control in WinPCS:</h3>
<p>
1. Calls to the <a href="lcxh.html#unicert">unicert( )</a> 
function or one of its special cases on 16-bit systems, 
<a href="lcxh.html#unicert">printcert( )</a> or
<a href="lcxh.html#unicert">certificate( )</a>.</p>

<p> 2. Some kind of Report or List-view data is to be formatted:</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="2"> <tbody>
<tr><td>Report</td> <td>Where the reference is</td> 
    <td>Formatting Files</td><td>Formatting Function</td> </tr>
<tr><td>SYNFARE List Views</td>  
    <td>WinPCS.INI section [REPORT]</td> <td>Entry FRAMEFILES=</td> <td>Entry FRAMEFUNCTION=</td></tr>
<tr><td>Exception reports</td>   
    <td>WinPCS.INI section [REPORT]</td> <td>Entry FRAMEFILES=</td> <td>Entry FRAMEFUNCTION=</td></tr>
<tr><td>Status index reports</td>     
        <td>REFREP table</td> <td>field LCXFILE</td><td>field FORM</td></tr>
<tr><td>Status index reports</td>     
        <td><a href="lcxh.html#statusindex">statusindex( )</a> </td> 
        <td>argument <em>filelist</em></td> <td>argument <em>function</em> </td></tr>
<tr><td>Standard (Quick-)reports</td> 
    <td>STDREP table</td> <td>Field FRAMEFILE</td> <td>Field FRAMEFUNCTION</td></tr>
<tr><td>Quantitative Reports</td> 
    <td>QREPORT.INI section</td> <td>formfiles=</td> <td>formfunctionW= or formfunctionR=</td></tr>
<tr><td>Programmed Reports</td> 
    <td>argument to <a href="lcxh.html#RepCreate">RepCreate( )</a> </td> 
	<td>argument <em>formfile</em></td> <td>argument <em>formfunction</em> </td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The status index reports are usually run based on the information in the REFREP table, but the code
in REFREP.LCX eventually call the <a href="lcxh.html#statusindex">statusindex( )</a> 
function with the parameters picked up from the fields as shown. </p>

<h3>Disallowed functions:</h3>
<p>DDE callback and functions are only available inside the DDE callback environment.  
There is however no restrictions on initiating DDE-operations. Another certificate
may not be created from within the formatting functions of another.</p>

<h3>LCX files:</h3>
<p>The files listed in the argument to the functions 
<a href="lcxh.html#unicert">unicert( )</a>, 
<a href="lcxh.html#certificate">certificate( )</a>,
<a href="lcxh.html#printcert">printcert( )</a>, or
<a href="lcxh.html#statusindex">statusindex( )</a>; or the files
listed in other INI files and tables as shown in the above table, 
must provide all the necessary functions. If the functions or files are not found, 
a system-provided default function will be used instead.</p>

<h3>Special Replacements:</h3>
<p>There is a movement towards placing the formatting functions into the AUTOCODE
table. For this to work right, the file-argument should be:</p>
<pre><b>AUTOCODE repform.lcx</b></pre>
<p>and the function should be a concatenation of a table-name and a suffix referring to the
report. This is handled automatically by the system for reports managed in REFREP, but
will have to be added manually in programmed reports: </p>

<pre>
// title, paperformat, table, funcp, are defined and set
Report = RepCreate(title, paperformat, "AUTOCODE repform.lcx", concat(table, "_", funcp), ... )
RepControl(concat("E:", makeset(table, "", "", funcp, title, "" )), Report); 
</pre>

<p>The E: extra-information is used by the formatting functions in AUTOCODE and repform.lcx. The 
specified  pattern will match what REFREP status-index reports have.</p>

<h3>Special functions:</h3>
<p>The Printing functions, such as 
<a href="lcxh.html#BoundedText"> BoundedText() </a>, 
<a href="lcxh.html#Height"> Height() </a>, 
<a href="lcxh.html#Hline"> Hline() </a>, 
<a href="lcxh.html#Image"> Image() </a>,  
<a href="lcxh.html#Line"> Line() </a>,
<a href="lcxh.html#Origin"> Origin() </a>, 
<a href="lcxh.html#Text"> Text() </a>, 
<a href="lcxh.html#Vline"> Vline() </a>, 
<a href="lcxh.html#Width"> Width() </a> 
are to be used to emit text onto the paper.</p>

<h2>1. For Certificates, </h2>
<p>The Callback function is called as</p>

<pre><em>lcxfunction</em><b>(</b><em>optarg, ... </em><b>)</b></pre>

<p>where the optarg are optional arguments passed through from the call to 
<a href="lcxh.html#certificate">certificate( )</a> or 
<a href="lcxh.html#printcert">printcert( )</a> this inner function. 
This called function may call more functions in different files, as long as all files are 
listed in the first argument to <a href="lcxh.html#certificate">certificate( )</a>.</p>

<p> All X and Y coordinates and dimensions are in 1/10mm units, measured above (Y) and to 
the right (X) of the Origin point. This is the lower left corner of the page, unless the 
<a href="lcxh.html#Origin">Origin( )</a> 
function has been called. Positive values of Y are upwards and positive values of  X are to the right, 
Where not otherwise noted, the X and Y values are signed, and negative values refer to 
locations below or to the left of the origin point. 
Normal LCX functions, except for the ones restricted to be used for DDE transactions 
only,  may be called in the course of drawing a certificate or form.  Notably, all the 
database interfacing functions (<a href="#get ">get ( )</a>, <a href="#findexact">findexact( )</a>, 
<a href="#startconnscan">startconnscan( )</a>, ... ) are available and 
may be used for generating texts and controlling the presence and absence of  various items.</p>

<h3>Return Value:</h3>
<p>Ignored. </p>

<a name="repformat"></a>
<h2>2. Report formatting</h2>

<p>This applies to all the various report formats. In general, SYNFARE and Exception reports use a common,
generic format, while Status Indexes and Quantitative Reports use specialized formats modified for each
report in the variety. </p>

<p>The report formatting functions are in all cases called with 12 arguments as follows:</p>

<pre><em>function</em><b>(</b><em>pagenumber</em><b>, </b><em> pagecount</em><b>, </b><em> first</em><b>, </b><em> last</em><b>, </b><em> keylegend</em><b>, </b><em> header</em><b>, </b><em> footer</em><b>, </b><em> arguments</em><b>, 
</b><em> columns</em><b>, </b><em> rows</em><b>, </b><em> pagelitra</em><b>, </b><em> treeinfo</em><b>)</b> </pre>

<p>The formatting function will be called once in advance, with a negative value for <em>pagenumber</em>.  During
this call, no actual drawing should take place, instead the function should calculate and 
return formatting <a href="#pageminus1"> information in a 7-part set, (see below),</a> comprising the report 
output area boundaries,left, top, right, bottom; the text font and size, and additional 
formatting flags.  Later calls where <em>pagenumber</em> is zero or positive and where drawing is 
to occur will have their return values ignored.</p>

<p>When the <em>pagenumber</em> is zero or positive, that means this page is in the process of being formatted. 
The function should use the drawing functions to draw text and lines on the page.  The report-data formatting
can be examined via the functions 
<a href="lcxh.html#ReportFirst">ReportFirst( )</a>, <a href="lcxh.html#ReportLast">ReportLast( )</a> , and
<a href="lcxh.html#ReportLegend">ReportLegend( )</a> , 
and the data-set report behind it can be found using 
<a href="lcxh.html#ReportRef">ReportRef( )</a> and then accessed using
<a href="lcxh.html#RepInfo">RepInfo( )</a> and <a href="lcxh.html#RepGet">RepGet( )</a>. 
When the <em>pagenumber</em> argument is zero or positive, the return value from the function is ignored.</p>

<p>The arguments are:</p>
<p><em>pagenumber</em> - the number of the page being formatted. This is -1 for the first, measurement call. 
Note that this is a base-0 number, if it is desired to print it out, add 1, or use the <em>pagelitra</em>
argument instead for this purpose. </p>
<p><em>pagecount</em> - this is the total number of pages being formatted. This is the initial estimate, but
any calls to 
<a href="lcxh.html#Newpage">Newpage( )</a> 
will  cause this number to increase. The main use of this is to get the total in "Page number X of T" strings.</p>
<p><em>first</em> - this is the value of the first key-field value appearing on the page.</p>
<p><em>last</em> - this is the value of the last key-field value appearing on the page.</p>
<p><em>keylegend</em> - this is the legend string of this key-field.</p>
<p><em>header</em> - header as defined from STATREES.INI or similar</p>
<p><em>footer</em> - footer as defined from STATREES.INI or similar</p>
<p><em>arguments</em> - Additional arguments passed in from the call to
statusindex argument <em>arguments</em>, or set with 
<a href="lcxh.html#RepControl">RepControl("E:<em>string</em>", <em>identifier</em>)</a>. 
Some specific conventions of REFREP.LCX and REPFORM.LCX have
been made. See below for these.</p>
<p><em>columns</em> - How many columns of report goes on this page</p>
<p><em>rows</em> - How many rows of report goes on this page</p>
<p><em>pagelitra</em> - Printable string for the pagenumber (base 1)</p>
<p><em>treeinfo</em> - Info on tree-lines in Status Index reports. These are inherited by the Quantitative 
Reports run from the status index reports. </p>

<p>The function 
<a href="lcxh.html#ReportRef">ReportRef( )</a> 
can be used to find the actual report-data handle of the report being printed, and thus
access the contents of the report directly. </p>

<h3>Example:</h3>
<p>This is a quite simple example. A lot of work has gone into configuring WinPCS so that formatting functions
are common to all reports and only column titles and widths have to be specified, including all the code for drawing
lines and legends around the Report itself. Here, the actual Report is drawn using DrawReport(). </p>

<pre>

fabrep(string pagenumber, string pagecount, string first, string last,
    string keylegend, string header, string footer)
{
    string top, center;
    string left, right, bottom;
    string flag1, delta;

    string rep, repdescr, user;

    bottom = 10;
    delta = 610;
    top = Height() - delta;
    left = 180;
    right = Width() - 30;
    center = (left + right) / 2;

    /* pagenumber &lt; 0 is measurement page */
    if(0 &lt; pagenumber)
    {
        rep = /* ReportFirst(column, page); */ first;
        findexact("FABREPRT", "REPORT_NO", rep);
        user = get("FABREPRT", "USER");
        repdescr = get("FABREPRT", "DESCRIPTION");

        Vline(left, top, bottom);
        Vline(right, top, bottom);
        Hline(left, right, top);
        Hline(left, right, bottom);

        DrawReport(right, top + delta, left, center, 
            user, rep, repdescr, pagenumber, pagecount); 
    }

    flag1 = concat("D:0 SN L:-20,-10 Cd:0 C1:230 C2:300 C3:60 C4:150 C5:150 C6:130 
C7:360 C8:30 C9:0 C10:0 C11:0");

    return(makeset(left + 20, top, right + 10, bottom, "Arial", 25, flag1));

}
</pre>

<a name="pageminus1"></a>
<h2>Return values for pagenumber -1</h2>

<p>As can be seen from the above example, the return values indicate the boundary of the report printing area, 
the font and size of the text in the report, and a set of flags for the report.  As usual, the sizes and 
coordinates are in 1/10 mm units, so in the above example, the text is 2.5 mm high and there are margins of
2 mm on the left side and 1 mmm to the right side, relative to the box drawn around the report-output area. </p>

<p>The flags indicate column sizing and other details in the report. In addtion to the ones shown there are also
commands for aligning text in the columns differently and for making some columns use a different font. All these
are detailed below:</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="2"> <tbody>
<tr><td>Key code</td><td>Description</td><td>Example</td> </tr>

<tr><td>S </td><td>Skip the first column from the report data set. This is usually because the data here is
all the same and will be referenced on the page.</td><td>S</td> </tr>

<tr><td>R </td><td>Repeat the first column on each horizontal page, this is when the report is so wide that
the data for some rows will not fit on a single page. This takes precedence over the S flag.</td><td>R</td> </tr>

<tr><td>N </td><td>Do not include the legends from the report. This means we will have to draw our own.
This is frequently the case, also the U: option for vertical lines is not requested then.
</td><td>N</td></tr>

<tr><td>L:<em>left</em>,<em>right</em></td><td>Draw horizontal lines, offset from
the left and right edge of the report data ares. L:-20,-10 means draw the lines 
extending 2 mm to the left of the report-data area, and stopping short 1 mm to the 
left of the right edge of the report-data area.  </td><td>L:-20,-10</td> </tr>

<tr><td>K:<em>number</em></td><td>Reserved, not defined </td><td>K:0</td> </tr>

<tr><td>D:<em>column[,column ...]</em></td><td>Start new page when there are changes in the data in one 
or more of these columns</td><td>D:0</td> </tr>

<tr><td>Cd:<em>width</em></td><td>Set default width of all columns not otherwise specified. 
Zero width of a column means it will not be displayed.
</td><td>Cd:0 </td> </tr>

<tr><td>C<em>column</em>:<em>width</em></td><td>Set the width of the indicated column. This overrides the default width set.</td><td>C4:150 sets the width of Column 
4 to 15 mm.</td> </tr>

<tr><td>Ad:<em>value</em></td><td>Set default alignment of all columns not otherwise specified. 
Alignment -1 is the default left-justified, alignment 0 is centered, alignement 1 is right-justified.
</td><td>Ad:-1 </td> </tr>

<tr><td>A<em>column</em>:<em>value</em></td><td>Set the alignment of the indicated column. This 
overrides the default alignments set.</td><td>A4:0 sets the alignment of Column 
4 to Centered.</td> </tr>

<tr><td>V:<em>height</em></td><td> Adds some extra vertical spacing between the rows.
The extra height is in the usual 1/10 mm. 
</td><td>V:5 adds 0.5 mm between the rows.</td></tr>

<tr><td>W:<em>wrapwidth</em></td><td> wrap text. The default is the 
WinPCS.INI [PPVIEW] WRAPWIDTH= value. </td><td>W:60</td></tr>

<tr><td>Fd:<em>number</em></td><td>Set default font for all columns not otherwise specified. 
Font 0 is the default. Fonts 0-9 are all the one specified in the return string unless one or more
of fonts number 1-9 has been specified in WinPCS.INI 
</td><td>Fd:1 Fd:7</td></tr>

<tr><td>F<em>column</em>:<em>number</em></td><td>Set the font for the indicated column. This 
overrides the default fonts set.</td><td>F4:3 sets the font of Column 4 to whatever 
has been defined as font 3.</td> </tr>

<tr><td>K:<em>functionname</em>(<em>columnnumber</em>, <em>columnnumber</em>, ... )
</td><td>Have a function look at some of the columns, and make it decide that the colors
in the report-rows should be different than the standard black-on-white. See the
section on Alternate Colors
below.</td> <td>K:colorstatus(3,4) looks at the strings passed it from columns 3 and 4.  </td> </tr>

<tr><td>U:<em>top,bottom</em></td><td> Draw vertical lines for the column boundaries, extending away from the
top and bottom boundaries by the values shown, much like the L: arguments adjust to the left and the right. 
Frequently, the formatting function wants to draw these lines itself along with the header fields. 
</td><td> </td> </tr>

</tbody></table>

<h3>Alternate Colors</h3>
<p>The alternate color functions take 4 arguments when called, and it should return a 3-part set of numbers.</p>

<p>First argument is the report-reference, second argument is the number of the row being handled,
the third argument is a set of the strings appearing in the rows listed in the K: command, and the 
fourth command is the index of the column currently having its text being drawn. 

Although the values are given directly as the strings they appear as, the column index under 
consideration can be used to determine if only some columns need to be differently colored.
If the entire row should have the same color, this can be ignored. </p>

<p>The first part of the return value is 0 for use standard black-on-white and 1 for use the colors
specified in the second part for the text, and the third part for the background. Text and background
colors are 0-black, 1-brown, 2-red, 3-orange, 4-yellow, 5-green, 6-blue, 7-purple, 8-gray, 9-white, 
10 and beyond are treated as RGB-quads, that are less convenient in decimal notation. </p>

<p>Example where the entire rows for things that are not started are colored red (2) on white (9):</p>
<pre>
colorstatus(string report, string row, string columnset, string column)
{
	if("not started" == setitem(columnset, 0))
	{
		return(makeset(1, 2, 9));  /* 2=red text 9=white background */ 
	}
	return(makeset(0, 0, 9));      /* default, the colors 0 and 9 for black text on white background are ignored here. */
}
</pre>



<h3>Alternate Fonts:</h3>
<p>There are 10 different alternate fonts, that can be specified in the file 
WinPCS.INI section [REPORT] entries FONT1= FONT2= etc. up to FONT9=.  Each entry is on the form
fontname+height+. A common use of this is for making barcodes in some column in the report.</p>

<h2>Conventions made for Status Index Reports</h2>
<p>The problem of formatting and managing status index reports have gradually found a solution. There are two
parts to this, one has to do with starting the reports and the other has to do with formatting them. </p>


<h3>Starting SI reports: REFREP and REFREP.LCX</h3>
<p>There is a function <b>DragSI( )</b> defined in the file REFREP.LCX, which is referenced from DDMATRIX. This
function calls the main function <b>SEL_SI( )</b>. Some of the Views also call <b>SEL_SI( )</b> from a pushbutton. </p>

<p>This function lists the relevant report specifications for the table from REFREP and if there is more than one,
opens up a selection-list. Further selection-lists may be specified by various values in the SELECTn and RESTRICTn
fields in the REFREP table.  The code in REFREP.LCX eventually calls the function
<a href="lcxh.html#statusindex">statusindex( )</a> 
with relevant parameters, and with the <em>argument</em> set to a multi-part set, suitable for later decoding
work in the formatting functions: </p>

<p><b>setitem(</b><em>argument</em><b>, 0):</b>Table. - This is the name of the table where the status index
    was started.</p>
<p><b>setitem(</b><em>argument</em><b>, 1):</b>Tag. - This is the number of the system or package or tag 
    where the status index was started. Note that when there is a multiple selection, this only lists the first
    one of the lot.  </p>
<p><b>setitem(</b><em>argument</em><b>, 2):</b>Field. - This is the field-name where the tag number is. </p>
<p><b>setitem(</b><em>argument</em><b>, 3):</b>SI-code. - This is the report code from REFREP, field REP_TYPE</p>
<p><b>setitem(</b><em>argument</em><b>, 4):</b>Title. - This is the title from ? </p>
<p><b>setitem(</b><em>argument</em><b>, 5):</b>Limits. - This is a string indicating other selection limits
    that applies such as one or more disciplines, one or more status codes and so on. </p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<pre>CERTSYS+DCP-010+SYSTEM_NO+A1+Pre-comm Status Index+ALL DISCIPLINES STATUS=Include ALL</pre>

<a name="autocode"></a>
<h3>Formatting SI reports: REPFORM.LCX and AUTOCODE</h3>
<p>In order to make report formats look uniform across the set of reports in projects, there are
a number of library functions defined in REPFORM.LCX, and a cooperation between these and the functions
defined and stored in the AUTOCODE table, for each report. The functions in AUTOCODE replace the ones
formerly in MCFORM.LCX, MCFORM2.LCX and others. </p>

<p>A number of modifications in the system are necessary to be able to use this subsystem:</p>
<p><b>A.</b> The "Report-editing" button should be added in the section [report] in
view.ini</p>
<pre>
Pdes=PDESIGN 1 (Configure printing format)
</pre>

<p> The symbol Pdes is defined in REFBMP31.ini as: </p>
<pre>
PDES=BT_FORMS       272 75 28 16
</pre>

<p><b>B.</b> "Quick reports" or "Custom reports" have their
non-AUTOCODE defaults in WinPCS.INI, but when AUTOCODE is in place, it
allows modifications and saving layouts for these reports as desired, then
with names linked to the user as well.</p>

<p><b>C.</b> To get the AUTOCODE subsystem working, the table must be created. 
Its layout is as follows, in TXS-file format:</p>
<pre>
AUTOCODE RSERIAL        0     0     4     R 0    M    0    A
AUTOCODE LCXFUNCTION    1     4     33    A 1    M    0    R
AUTOCODE DESCRIPTION    2     37    80    A -1   N    -1   R
AUTOCODE CONTEXT        3     117   20    A 2    B    0    R
AUTOCODE CREATED_BY     8     137   20    A 3    B    0    R
AUTOCODE CREATED_ON     9     157   4     D 4    B    0    R
AUTOCODE ICON           4     161   20    Z -1   N    -1   R
AUTOCODE LCXCODE        5     181   3800  Z -1   N    -1   R
</pre>
<p>This table is managed for the formatting of the reports, both programmed
and others, and there should be no need for editing records here directly
using INSP -- this is possible but can be tedious...</p>

<p>Note also that there should be a record defined in CXDICT for the AUTOCODE 
table as well. </p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="2"> <tbody>
<tr><td>Field</td> <td>Value</td> </tr>
<tr><td>ITEMBASE</td><td>AUTOCODE</td></tr>
<tr><td>ITEMFLD</td><td>LCXFUNCTION</td></tr>
<tr><td>ITEMUNIFLD</td><td>RSERIAL</td></tr>
<tr><td>ITEMDESFLDS</td><td>DESCRIPTION</td></tr>
<tr><td>ITEMDFCOUNT</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>DEFAULTICON</td><td>BMFUNCTION</td></tr>
<tr><td>ITEMICON</td><td>ICON</td></tr>
<tr><td>ITEMICONMODE</td><td>C</td></tr>
<tr><td>ISCORED</td><td>N</td></tr>
<tr><td>BASEDESCR</td><td>Generated Code</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Other fields in CXDICT that are not listed should remain blank.</p>

<p>In order to save the formats, there should also be two USYM entries, EAUTOCODE 
and VAUTOCODE, with appropriate permission settings; as not everyone may be 
allowed to create and change AUTOCODE layouts. This is controlled via the USYM 
entry EAUTOCODE, in a manner analogous to the way the access to other Entry 
forms are handled. VAUTOCODE is for the benefit of any View that one may want
to create for AUTOCODE and link into the menu.</p>

<p><b>D.</b> To make reports work with AUTOCODE instead of the older per-report
functions in mcform.lcx and suchlike, the formatting file names list,
field LCXFILE, in REFREP should be changed to:</p>
<pre>
AUTOCODE REPFORM.LCX
</pre>
<p>for all the SI reports that you want to use the AUTOCODE. In most recent
systems this is just all of them -- most have been very happy to be able
to edit and adjust the layouts without having to edit LCX files -- but if
there is one or more special layouts that is not readily handled by the
AUTOCODE, you can retain the old layout file and function references for
these.</p>

<p>The naming convention for the functions for these reports are the
concatenation of the ITEMBASE and REPTYPE values from REFREP, thus
CERTAC1_A1 will be the name of the formatting function for the A1 report
run off CERTAC1.</p>

<p><b>E.</b> For Q-reports, there are a few more things to consider.</p>

<p><b>E1.</b> Since the same standard q-report can be run several different ways off
the same or different status index reports, there are more elements to the
function-naming of these. The function begins with the one from the
SI-report (ITEMBASE _ REPTYPE), then the section in the QREPORT.INI file
(such as QPLSYS or QASHREP) then a suffix from the definition in STAREP.INI, then a
W or R for the Wide or Rectangular mode report, as applicable.</p>

<pre>
$button QTOS=QREPORT1 0 (TO System Discipline) QPLSYS S:1 L:6 G:9,9
$button CalcX=QREPORT5 1 (SubSystem Discipline) QPLSYS S:2 L:6 G:9,9
$button CalcS=QREPORT2 1 (Unit/Site Discipline) QPLSYS S:0 L:6 G:9,9
$button CSSy=QREPORT3 0 (Cat. by Subsystem) QPLCAT S:2 L:8 G:9,9
$button CTO=QREPORT4 0 (Cat. by TO System) QPLCAT S:1 L:8 G:9,9
</pre>
<p>This suffix is whatever follows the word QREPORT in the button
definitions, this is usually a single letter or digit, but could be
anything really; the important thing is that all the QREPORT buttons in
any one SI report layout, that is, any one section of STAREP.INI, have
different suffixes.  The formatting of the first of these will be
something like CERTSYS_PL_QPLSYS_1W and CERTSYS_PL_QPLSYS_1R for example.
The 1 is the digit 1 following the QREPORT word in the definition.</p>

<p><b>E2.</b> The second thing to change is analogous to the change to REFREP -- the
formatting files list should include AUTOCODE, thus all formfiles= entries
in the various sections in QREPORT.INI should be changed to read:</p>
<pre>
formfile=AUTOCODE repform.lcx
</pre>
<p>The formfunction= is not used, it can be left as it is (usually it is
something like "qreportformat")</p>

<p><b>F.</b> The last kind of reports are the programmed reports. These usually
begin as RepCreate() calls in various LCX files in the system32 directory,
and they have to be given some "extra-string" values, so that the
formatting functions get the necessary supporting information for its
job.  Like the SI-reports and the Q-reports, the formatting files have to
be specified as "AUTOCODE repform.lcx" here as well. The function-names
have to be defined as some suitable concatenation of a table-name and a
report-code, mimicing the names generated for the status index reports,
and there has to be an "extra" string set, that contains these elements.</p>

<p>A fairly typical sequence will be:</p>
<pre>

      funcp = "EMITTABLE";

      Report = RepCreate(title, "P",
              "AUTOCODE repform.lcx", concat(itembase, "_", funcp),
          makeset ("CI", "Data Number", 30),
          makeset ("CI", "Week", 10),
          makeset ("CI", "Total", 10),
          makeset ("CI", "Cleared this week", 10),
          makeset ("CI", "Cleared", 10),
          makeset ("CI", "Active", 10) );

      RepControl(concat("E:",
              makeset(itembase, "", "", funcp, title, "" ) ), Report);

</pre>
<p>The Extra-string is a 6-part set, where the first and fourth elements are
the two names (here they are in the variables itembase and funcp) being
used to assemble the formatting function name. The sixth element is the
title of the report.</p>

<p>Both of these names, by convention, consist of capital letters and digits,
but they don't have to refer to any real table, even though there usually
is some main table of interest in these reports, and that will be a good
candidate for the first part of the name. The idea is to be able to
distinguish the names of all the various reporting formatting functions.</p>

<p>Now, if you don't want to allow changing the format of some specific
programmed report, the argument
makeset("PX", "PDESIGN") given to RepCreate(), preceeding or following the
various makeset("CI", ...) arguments, will cause the exclusion of the
PDESIGN pushbutton.  In this case, the formatting files and functions
should not include AUTOCODE.</p>


<h3>Formatting SI reports: REPFORM.LCX, MCFORM.LCX/MCFORM2.LCX</h3>
<p>This is the older style of configuration. It still works, but is being replaced with the AUTOCODE-based
configuration detailed above.</p> 
<p>To make the report formats look uniform across the set of reports in the projects, a number of library
functions in REPFORM.LCX and MCFORM.LCX are used for as many of the reports as possible. Even other reports,
such as SYNFARE or standard-reports use some of these functions, via the code in R1PAGE.LCX. (these 
usually use the function <b>printpage( )</b> in R1PAGE.LCX.  </p>

<p>This layout-function is named <b>DrawMCHeader()</b> but for report printouts, it is wrapped inside another, 
more complete function called <b>DoRestOfReport()</b>, which also deals with the vertical lines separating the data
fields.  The idea is that the column widths and titles are specified in these functions, then all the common
details are done by <b>DoRestOfReport()</b>, hence that name. Now, this function needs to make a few callbacks
for the names and titles. These functions all have names such as "DecodeXXXN" and "DecodeXXXU". Look at the
actual MCFORM.LCX and REPFORM.LCX files for details on these.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<pre>
/* A and B sheet status index format */
mcsilist(string pagenumber, string pagecount, string first,
    string last, string keylegend, string unheader, string footer,
    string extra, string ucol, string urow, string pagelitra)
{
    string Ldxset, Rdxset, names1, names2, rr;

    Ldxset = makeset(  0,  140,      300,   180   );   Rdxset = makeset(0,   0,  0,  200,    0,    170,     0,  150,      150,      0,  200  );
    names1 = makeset("", "Sub-",   " Tag", "Tag",   "Tag",             "", "",  "", "Check", "",  "Item",   "", "Insp.",  "Disc.",  "", "Cleared");
    names2 = makeset("", "System", " No.", "Type",  "Description",     "", "",  "", "Sheet:, "",  "Status", "", "ID",     "",       "", "Date");

    rr = DoRestofReport(pagenumber,  pagelitra, pagecount, first,
        last, keylegend, unheader, footer,
        extra, "DecodeREFREPExtraU", "DecodeREFREPExtraN",
        Ldxset, Rdxset, "", names1, names2, "");

    return(rr);
}
</pre>

<p>This shows how the columns are specified in the two sets Ldxset and Rdxset, where 0 means the column isn't shown
and the other values are the usual 1/10 mm units.  Ldxset specifies the fields bound to the left margin, Rdxset 
specifies fields anchored to the right margin. One field in the middle does not have its width specified, this is
so it can take up the slack when the paper widths change, between A4 and US A (8.5 by 11 inches) for example. 
Usually such fields are descriptions that don't require or have a particular controlled width, in this case this
is the description of the tag. </p>

<p>Note that the functions generated and stored in AUTOCODE are very similar to the above example; the difference
is that the user has an easier job of editing and testing the function via the PDESIGN dialog.</p>

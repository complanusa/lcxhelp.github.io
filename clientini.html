<h1>CLIENT.INI Client configuration file reference.</h1>
<p> File Date: June 25 2005</p>

<p>This references the secondary configuration file for the client. 
Like other .ini files, this file has a number of sections
with entries in them, and the sections may appear in any order. 
</p>

<p>The sections are: <br/>
<a href="#section.20drives">[drives]</a><br/>
<a href="#section.20LCX">[LCX]</a><br/>
</p>

<hr/>
<a name="section.20drives"></a>
<h2>[drives]</h2>
<p>This defines the meaning of the numbered drives for the client. 
The default is that all numbered drives, 0: thru 9: refer to the 
system-directory where ANCHORC.DLL and the CLIENT.INI file are. 
Entries here will override this default.  </p>

<p>Note that when resolving paths (through <a href="lcxh.html#ReducePath">ReducePath( )</a>),
the paths are tried in order from 0: to 9:, so 9: should be the most general one for this
to work. Also, in many cases, the drive numbers for the server and client will 
coincide, and the convention is also that drive 9: is set to the parent directory of the
SERVER or SYSTEM32 directories, which is the root of the WinPCS installation in the most usual 
cases.</p>

<p>The entries in this section are all on the form:<br/>
<em>digit</em><b>=</b><em>path</em></p>

<p>The path can be relative to the System32 directory, such as the very common definition of drive 9:<br/>
<b>9=..</b><br/>
or it can be an absolute path referring to a available storage unit on a different machine, for example:<br/>
<b>3=\\server_1\WinPCS_Scanned</b><br/></p>

<p>As mentioned, any drive number not referenced here defaults to the system32 directory, so calling
<a href="lcxh.html#ExpandPath">ExpandPath( )</a> 
with drive numbers not otherwise defined, will return this directory.</p>

<a name="section.20LCX"></a>
<h2>[LCX]</h2>
<p>The entries in this section list files being used client-side for certain activities.
At the moment, only some of the status indexes' functions for pushbuttons are referenced
in these files. Field-functions are done on the server.</p>

<p>The entries are:<br/>
<a href="#SI"><b>SI=</b></a><br/>
<a href="#PRLIST"><b>PRLIST=</b></a><br/>
</p>

<a name="SI"></a>
<h3>SI=</h3>
<p>This entry should list a series of LCX macrofiles that contain all functions being used from
pushbutton actions in SI-reports. Additionally, functions in the set of client-global code, 
GLOBAL.LCX, are also available for use.</p>

<a name="PRLIST"></a>
<h3>PRLIST=</h3>
<p>This entry lists the files to be used with the "print all" command
in the Quick Reports.  </p>

<h1>Qreport.ini file reference</h1>
<p>File Date: November 23 2005</p>

<p>The file 
Qreport.ini defines the quantitative reports that can be run based on information from
status index reports. They are started from pushbutton commands in status index reports. This file
lives in the main directory of the client program, (often called SYSTEM32).</p>

<p>Summaries are made for a combination of values 

<h2>Pushbutton definitions</h2>
<p>The start commands are 
specified via pushbutton definitions in the report layouts in the file STAREP.INI. These 
pushbuttons have the QREPORTx command-word. Note that these definitions are found in STAREP.INI not QREPORT.INI, but
it makes more sense discussing the details here.</p>

<p>The relevant pushbutton definitions are as per</p>

<pre><b>$button</b> <em>icon</em><b>=QREPORT</b><em>suffix</em><b> 1 (</b><em>Explanation</em><b>) </b> <em>sectionname</em> <b>L:</b><em>leadindex</em> <b>S:</b><em>setindexlist</em> <b>G:</b><em>groupindexlist</em> <b>T:</b><em>countindexlist</em> </pre>

<pre><b>$button</b> <em>text</em><b>=QREPORT</b><em>suffix</em><b> 0 (</b><em>Explanation</em><b>) </b> <em>sectionname</em> <b>L:</b><em>leadindex</em> <b>S:</b><em>setindexlist</em> <b>G:</b><em>groupindexlist</em> <b>T:</b><em>countindex</em> </pre>

<p>The <em>suffix</em> is some string that allows us to make a distinction between several possible
quantitative reports from the same status index report, per system, subsystem, discipline, 
site, or whatever else is of interest. The <em>text</em> 
is the text to appear on the pushbutton, the <em>icon</em> is the name of the symbol defined in REFBMP31.INI to
appear on the pushbutton, and the <em>Explanation</em> is the helpful description of the pushbutton. These are 
standard items that apply to all kinds of pushbuttons.</p>

<p>The <em>sectionname</em> identifies the sections in the QREPORT.INI file that holds the specifications of this
quantitative or summary report. There is a pair of sections referenced in this file this way, one section defines
parameters surrounding the report, and the other section, suffixed -FIELDS, refers to the fields in the report.</p>

<p>The trailing commands refer to the fields in the status index report that are used for input. The somewhat 
non-mnmemonic letters reflects the design language of the reports: There is one or more <b>G</b>roups of distinct
values that are to be <b>L</b>isted with combinations of fields giving the <b>L</b>eading text, either all in one list, or
optionally divided further, for each one found in some <b>S</b>et of high-level organizational objects. 
Additionally, values in other columns can optionally be <b>T</b>allied and the counts summarized. Hence the letters. </p>

<p>The typical case is that the Groups are the status values, these are Listed by discipline, and these combinations
are repeated for each subsystem, often defined by including both the subsystem numbers and their descriptions. </p>

<p>The commands S: L: G: T: can appear in any order. S: and T: are optional, though S: is usually present, 
and L: and G: are mandartory. Their arguments are one or more integers referring to the columns in the input status index
report, first column is indexed as 0, and so on to the right. </p>

<p>The <i>setindexlist</i> can refer to one or more fields, whose concatenation of values form the distinct Set values.
This concatenation can be exploited to generate more informative strings for the set-values, by including for example 
both the unique tag number (system number, sheet number etc.) and the description fields. The resulting concatenated
string will still be distinct. </p>

<p>This indexing is also used for miscellaneous LCX macrofunctions that may be run via LCXCALL pushbuttons. See the 
<a href="call3206.html"> Pushbutton Operations (client/server) (32-bit) </a> and the 
<a href="call1606.html"> Pushbutton Operations (monolithic) (16-bit) </a> pages for the details on these.</p>

<p>The Yes/No columns associated with $select= entries are
indexed at the end, although this field appears at the extreme left. Adding or removing any such field does not affect
the indexing for the purposes of subsequent reports.</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>The following section from a STAREP.INI shows a few QREPORT buttons and 
a couple other fairly typical elements of such a status index report layout:</p>

</pre>

<p>The comments at the end of each line defining the fields (;0 ;1 and so on)
indicate the field index. These are not really defined as comments, it's just that
the program that is reading the entries in these files does not care about what goes 
after the right parenthesis delimiting the field legend. </p>

<p>There are 4 different pushbutton defining various quantitative reports here, they are 
distinguished as QREPORT1, QREPORT2 and so on. It is typical that numerical suffixes like 
these are used, but there is nothing special about these other than that they serve to make
the button references different, for the benefit of possible subsequent calls to 
<a href="lcxh.html#RepControl">RepControl( )</a>.</p>

<p>Two of the QREPORTs refer to section QPLSYS (and QPLSYS-FIELDS) in QREPORT.INI, the others
refer to QPLCAT. We also see that they refer to different Listing fields, and there are two Groups, 
both being the field for Status, column 8, the entry above reading:</p>
<pre>
#LEAF STATUS SCODED=10 (Status)                 ; 8
</pre>
<p>Column 5 is Discipline, Column 7 is the Category, and the two sets of quantitative reports therefore lists
counts of all combinations found of status-values and disciplines or categories. </p>

<h3>Definitions in programmed Reports</h3>
<p>The Q-reports can also be invoked from programmed Reports, the ones created using 
<a href="lcxh.html#RepCreate">RepCreate( )</a>. In the definition
arguments, where fields and pushbuttons are defined, a pushbutton definition such as</p>

<pre><b>makeset("PB","CalcX", "QREPORT1 1 (SubSystem Discipline) QPLSYS S:1 L:5 G:8,8"), </b></pre>

<p>will allow running these kinds of summary reports here. Notice that the third element in the set is the same 
as whatever is to the right of the = sign in the STAREP.INI entry. </p>

<h2>The sections [<i>sectionname</i>]</h2>
<p>There are the following entries in this section:</p>

<p><a href="#entry.20input">input=</a> This refers to where the input data can be found. </p>
<p><a href="#entry.20mode">mode=</a> This indicates if there is the Wide or the Rectangular version. </p>
<p><a href="#entry.20title">title=</a> This defines the title.</p>
<p><a href="#entry.20orientW">orientW=</a> This sets the paper orientation for the wide form of the report</p>

<p><a href="#entry.20formfunctionW">formfunctionW=</a> This is the formatting layout function for the Wide report</p>
<p><a href="#entry.20formfunctionR">formfunctionR=</a> This is the formatting layout function for the Rectangular </p>

<p><a href="#entry.20hidezero">hidezero=</a> This indicates how zero values are to be shown</p>
<p><a href="#entry.20omitzerosum">omitzerosum=</a> This indicates whether zero sum rows are to be omitted</p>
<p><a href="#entry.20root">root=</a> This gives the title and size of the Leading text, L: field. </p>
<p><a href="#entry.20sumtitle">sumtitle=</a> This is the title or keyword of the sum for each of the</p>
<p><a href="#entry.20sumtotal">sumtotal=</a> This is the keyword for the sum over everything in the Rectangular Report. </p>
<p><a href="#postprocessW">postprocessW=</a> Allows for a postprocessing function to be run on the Wide report, after the report is generated but before it is displayed</p>
<p><a href="#postprocessR">postprocessR=</a> Allows for a postprocessing function to be run on the Rectangular report, after the report is generated but before it is displayed</p>

<p>More details are given on these under the various headings below, for each of these entries. </p>

<a name="entry.20input"/>
<h3>input=</h3>
<p>This refers to where the input data can be found. The only defined value is VIEWREP, thus this
will always read</p>
<pre>
input=VIEWREP
</pre>

<a name="entry.20mode"/>
<h3>mode=</h3>
<p>This is set to W, R, or WR, to indicate if the report is to be shown in its 
Wide or Rectangular version, or both. The Wide report has a set of columns for each 
combination of the Group-fields and List-fields, while the Rectangular report adds another 
row for each of these combinations.  The 16-bit systems had problems with the Wide reports
when there were too many columns; the 32-bit systems have no such problems.
</p>

<a name="entry.20title"/>
<h3>title=</h3>
<p> This defines the title to be displayed in the window.
Since several different phases can share a quantitative report, there is a mechanism for making
all or part of the title from an LCX function, where the statement 
<b>$macro(</b><em>file</em><b>, </b><em>function</em><b>)</b> is 
replaced by the return value from that function. </p>

<p>The file is expected to be in the same directory where qreport.ini itself is. 
The function takes a single argument which identifies the parent SI report, and it 
can use this in functions such as <a href="lcxh.html#RepInfo">RepInfo( )</a> or 
<a href="lcxh.html#RepGet ">RepGet ( )</a> to look at data in the report. </p>

<p>Example:</p>
<p><b>title=$macro(mcform.lcx, QABreptitle) Status Report Summary</b></p>
<p>The function <b>QABreptitle</b> is defined as:
<pre>
QABreptitle(string SIReport)
{
    string aorb, rti, rti1, rti2;
    rti = RepInfo("title", SIReport);
    rti1 = substr(rti, 1, 1);
    rti2 = substr(rti, 1, 2);
    if("V" == rti1) { aorb = "Vendor A-Sheet"; }
    else if("S" == rti1) { aorb = "Software A-Sheet"; }
    else if("Co" == rti2) { aorb = "Component"; }
    else if("A" == rti1) { aorb = "A-Sheet"; }
    else if("B" == rti1) { aorb = "B-Sheet"; }
    else { aorb = substr(rti, 1, 7); }
    return(aorb);
}
</pre>
and this simply looks at the beginning of the title of the SI report and generates the part
of the title text from that, so it becomes "A-Sheet Status Report Summary" 
or "Component Status Report Summary" and so on. So far, only the title= entry 
uses this particular substitution mechanism.</p>

<a name="entry.20orientW"/>
<a name="entry.20orientR"/>
<h3>orientW= orientR= orient=</h3>
<p> This sets the paper orientation for the wide or rectangular forms of the report, 
or both of them at the same time. orientW= and orientR= take precedence over orient=. 
If the argument is a nonzero integer or a word beginning with L, the format will be Landscape, 
if the argument is zero or a word beginning with any other letter, the format will be Portrait. 
It is recommended that one of the words Landscape or Portrait be used. 
</p>

<a name="entry.20formfile"/>
<h3>formfile=</h3>
<p> This is the reference to the file where the formatting function or functions are to be found
The file or files (there can be more than one, listed with spaces between them) are expected to 
be in the system directory.</p>

<a name="entry.20formfunctionW"/>
<a name="entry.20formfunctionR"/>
<a name="entry.20formfunction"/>
<h3>formfunctionW= formfunctionR= formfunction=</h3>
<p> This defines the formatting layout function for the W and R mode reports, or a common one if
the distinction between the formatting functions is of interest.  Some systems have used the number
of columns to try and determine which report mode is used, but that is error-prone. It may be easier
to have a separate function for each mode. </p>

<p>The specified formatting layout function, should exist in one of the files listed in formfile=</p>

<p>The functions follow the usual spec for a 
<a href="call0010.html">report-formatting function</a>.</p>

<a name="entry.20hidezero"/>
<h3>hidezero=</h3>
<p> This indicates if zero values are to be shown as '0' or blank. Set to 1 makes it show zero values 
and counts as blank, set it to 0 to make the 0s appear.</p>

<a name="entry.20omitzerosum"/>
<h3>omitzerosum=</h3>
<p> This indicates if zero sum values are to be shown as blanks or 0. 
Set to 1 to make the zero sum values go away, and 0 to make these show 0s instead of blanks. </p>

<a name="entry.20root"/>
<h3>root=</h3>
<p> This gives the title and size of the Leading text, L: field. The entry is expected to be
two elements, first an integer showing the width, then the legend in a pair of round parentheses.  
</p>

<a name="entry.20sumtitle"/>
<h3>sumtitle=</h3>
<p> This is the title or keyword of the sum for each of the groups. 
A Typical useful word is OVERALL.
</p>

<a name="entry.20sumtotal"/>
<h3>sumtotal=</h3>
<p> This is the keyword for the sum over everything in the Rectangular Report. 
A Typical useful word is TOTALS.
</p>

<a name="postprocessR"/>
<a name="postprocessW"/>
<h3>postprocessR= postprocessW=</h3>
<p>These allow some LCX function to be used for doing postprocessing, 
on the report, for adding additional records for example. The postprocessR= 
is for the rectangular report and postprocessW= is for the Wide report. 
Unlike the others that have R and W versions, there is no common one here; the
W and R ones will have to be specified separately, as they commonly are different.</p>

<p>The synopsis for this entry is<br/>
<b>postprocessR=</b><em>functionname optionalargs</em><br/>
<b>postprocessW=</b><em>functionname optionalargs</em></p>

<p>The function will then be called as:<br/>
<em>functionname(reportref, optionalargs, qreportinisection)</em><br/>
where 
<ul> 
<li> <em>functionname</em> is the name given in the postprocessW or postprocessR entry
<li> <em>reportref</em> will be the report-handle of the quantitative report, suitable for
	use with functions such as
	<a href="lcxh.html#RepGet">RepGet( )</a>,
	<a href="lcxh.html#RepInfo">RepInfo( )</a>, or
	<a href="lcxh.html#RepPut">RepPut( )</a> in order to look at the report and
	modify its contents before it is shown. </li>

<li> <em>optionalargs</em> is the rest of the text following the function-name in the entry.
	The string could be anything useful, such as a set or list of column index numbers
	that might be slightly different between otherwise similar reports, making it possible
	to use the same function from different reports or modes of reports. </li>

<li> <em>qreportinisection</em> is the name of the section where this function reference was made.
	It can be used with <a href="lcxh.html#getinistring">getinistring( )</a> 
	to look at other strings in this section, possibly for additional parameters or whatever else
	might be of interest. </li>

</ul>
</p>
<p>The function should return <b>0</b>. Although its return value is ignored now, this could change 
sometime. By then, the return <b>0</b> will be interpreted as the original behavior, so all the existing
reports won't break.  </p>

<p>The function is expected to be in one of the pre-loaded files, that is, in winpcs.ini section [winpcs]
entry library=</p>

<p>The modified qreport is shown once the function returns.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<pre>
[QPLSYS]
input=VIEWREP
mode=WR
title=Punchlist Status Quantitative Report
orientW=Landscape
orientR=Portrait
formfile=mcform2.lcx repform.lcx
formfunction=qPLformat
hidezero=1
omitzerosum=1
root=15 (Disp.)
sumtitle=OVERALL
sumtotal=TOTALS
postprocessW=KRLtestp 1,2,3,4
postprocessR=KRLtestp 5,6,7,8
</pre>

<pre>
KRLtestp(string report, string tail, string inisection)
{
	string rcount, colcount;
	rcount = RepInfo("rows", report);
	colcount = RepInfo("cols", report);

	message(__HERE__, "Hello from qreport ", report, " tail = ", tail, 
		" qreport.ini section [", inisection, "] size ", rcount, " by ", 
		colcount); 

	return(0);
}
</pre>

<p>The postprocess function will probably not have any calls to user-interface functions such as 
<a href="lcxh.html#message">message( )</a> or <a href="lcxh.html#selectdialog">selectdialog( )</a>; 
the above example just shows that it does work. It has to pick apart the string of arguments appearing 
in the <tt>tail</tt> variable using 
<a href="lcxh.html#converttoset">converttoset( )</a> 
<a href="lcxh.html#setitem">setitem( )</a> 
<a href="lcxh.html#strchr">strchr( )</a> 
or similar functions. </p> 


<h2>The sections [<i>sectionname</i>-FIELDS]</h2>
<p>The entries in this section defines the fields in the quantitative report. </p>

<p>Each entry defines a group number, an operation code and a key value, while the right side
defines the column width and a legend. <p>

<p>The group number is a small integer, corresponding to the groups listed as arguments to the 
G: parameter to the pushbutton on start. The number 1 refers to the first group field listed after
the G:, the number 2 refers to the second one and so on, for as many as are defined.  </p>

<p>The opcodes are one of PRIM SUM SEC PERCENT, where the PRIM indicates that this is a primary
value that is to be counted and displayed. SEC indicates a secondary value that is to be grouped 
with one of the PRIM values, they are identified by specifying the same width and column title on 
the right side of the = as their associated PRIM. SUM indicates a sum column for the group, there 
should be exactly one SUM entry for each group.  PERCENT refers to one of the PRIM columns, and is used
to display the fraction of the value shown there to the value in the SUM field.</p>

<p>The keyword, which appears in a pair of round parenthesese, is expected to match values found
in the columns under consideration. PRIM and SEC expects to find matches in the input status 
index report, the PERCENT looks for the title of one of the PRIM columns. </p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>In a punchlist, the status may be shown with one of the strings "Cleared", "Verified", and "Active".
There are two groups, both using the status values, to handle the counting of these three and their
combinations. The logic goes that Group 1 counts the cleared and verified ones together in one column,
labeled "No. Cleared"
and the active ones in another column, while Group 2 separates the ones that are Verified from the
ones that are merely Active and Cleared. The percentages of Cleared and Verified are also shown, and
the SUM for group 2 is set to 0 width so that field becomes invisible.
</p>

<pre>
[QPLSYS-FIELDS]
1 SUM (any)=15 (Total)
1 PRIM (Cleared)=10 (No. Cleared)
1 SEC (Verified)=10 (No. Cleared)
2 PRIM (Verified)=10 (No. Verified)
1 PRIM (Active)=10 (No. Active)
1 PERCENT (No. Cleared)=15 (% Cleared)
2 PERCENT (No. Verified)=15 (% Verified)
2 SEC (Cleared)=0 (No. Unverified)
2 PRIM (Active)=0 (No. Unverified)
2 SUM (any)=0 (Total 2)

<h1>View, Entry, and Report Pushbuttons Operations -- Category 6 (16-bit WinPCS)</h1> <p> 

<h3>Function calls in this category are made:</h3>
1. In reponse to pushing a button in a View, defined to do the 
LCXCALL or LCXCALLA operation.<br>
2. In response to a $LCXMACRO command on a field in an Entry 
Form. (on 32-bit systems, this kind of field may appear in 
View Forms as well) See Entry $LCXMACRO calls  for more details on this.<br>
3. In response to the use of the System/Run Macro command.<br>
4. In response to an LCXCALL pushbutton in a status index  report as defined in STDREP.<br>

<h3>1. Enabling control in WinPCS: </h3>
The LCXCALL definition in View .INI files

<p>There is one call per push.
<p>The LCXCALL definition in View .INI files is:
  <p>  Legend=LCXCALL 0 (explanation) filename function tailarg ...

<h3>LCX files and Callback function for View .INI files:</h3>

    status = function(view, base, tailarg ... )

<p>where view is EVIEW5 and the base is the name of the base being 
Viewed. The tailarg arguments are the words on the rest of the line 
in the LCXCALL definition. This is often used for additional fieldnames. 
The filename and function name is referred to in the button definition 
in the View .INI file.

<h3>3. Enabling control in 16-bit WinPCS: </h3>
System/Run Macro command

<p>The user selects the macro file and function in the 
following dialogs. There are no 
arguments, and the return value is ignored.

<h3>4. Enabling control in 16-bit WinPCS:</h3>
The LCXCALL definition in STADLG.INI Report sections
( sipush.c LCXrun(MC->SCU->LChLC, MC->SCU->LCfselname, 
MC->SCU->LCargv, 5, txt, 128); )

<p>This is defined in SI sections as:
$button legend=LCXCALL odraw (Explanation) function optional tail-args
and when the button is pushed, the call takes place as
function(tail, tableset, rootitem, rootbase, SIname) 
<p>
tail = any trailing text on the line in STATREES.INI<br>
tableset = set of tables used initially, only useful in single-leaf-type status indexes<br>
rootitem = Trunk-item identity<br>
rootbase = Trunk-level table<br>
SIname = Name of SI as defined in STATREES.INI<br>

<p>Use the <a href="lcxh.html#RepInfo">RepInfo("ident")</a> 
function to get the identity of the default Report-object corresponding to the SI report.

<h3>Example:</h3>

$button LCX=LCXCALL 0 (Where is this?) zzyzx Tail-arg.goes.here and here

where the function zzyzx( ) looks like:

zzyzx(string tail, string junkset, string a, string b, string c)
{
    string rod, n2, n1;
    rod = RepInfo("ident");
    n2 = RepInfo("rows", rod);
    n1 = RepInfo("rows");
    message("zzyzx", "Tail = ", tail,
        " Report ID = ", rod,
        " Rows I=", n2, " nI=", n1);
    return(0);
}


This produces the message box text along the following lines:

Tail =  Tail-arg.goes.here and here
Report ID = 15624 Rows I=28 nI=28

<h3>Special replacements:</h3>
None. If the function is non-existent an error message will appear in its place. 
<h3>Execution context:</h3>
Not shared and not re-entered.

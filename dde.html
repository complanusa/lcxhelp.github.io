<h1>WinPCS as a DDE Server</h1>

<p>WinPCS has the capabilities to run as a DDE server. </p>

<p> Like other DDE servers, WinPCS has a name, a number of topics, and 
items within each topic. There is always a System Topic.</p>

<p> The System Topics item will reflect whatever Topics are present at any 
one time, and every topic (including System) will contain the 
TopicItemList and CommandList items 
likewise showing the currently  available Items and Commands in that Topic.</p>

<p> The name is <b>WINPCS</b>, and DDE is case-insensitive, so any 
combinations of uppercase and lowercase will do. </p>

<p> Items may be Requested or Poked. If no Poke option is shown, the 
item does not require any Poked values.</p>

<p> Commands are executed. The syntax is in general: </p>
<pre><b>[</b><em>command</em><b>(</b><em>argument</em><b>, </b><em>argument</em><b>, ... )]</b></pre>

<p>where the number of arguments required or allowed depends on the particular 
command as documented below. </p>

<p> Several commands in a row may be executed in one go by enclosing each command in 
its own pair of square brackets. They will then be executed left-to-right.</p>

<p> WinPCS provides the <a href="#The.20System.20Topic">System Topic</a> and the 
<a href="#The.20Macros.20Topic">Macros Topic</a>. </p>

<hr/><a name="The.20System.20Topic"></a> <h2>The System Topic</h2> 

<p>The following Items appear in the System Topic:</p>
<pre><b> Formats, TopicItemList, Sysitems, CommandList, Protocols, Topics.  </b></pre>

<p> The following Command is defined:</p>
<pre><b>View</b></pre>

<h3>Item: Formats</h3>
<p>On Request, returns the supported formats in the WinPCS Macros topic. </p>

<h3>Items: TopicItemList, SysItems</h3>
<p>On Request, returns a tab-separated list of items defined in the System Topic. </p>

<h3>Item: CommandList</h3>
<p>On Request, returns the tab-separated list of commands defined in the Macro Topic. </p>

<h3>Item: Protocols</h3>
<p>On Request, returns the supported execute protocols of the WinPCS server.</p>

<h3>Item: Topics</h3>
<p>On Request, returns the tab-separated list of Topics defined in the Server WinPCS. At 
present, only the two topics <b>System</b> and <b>Macros</b> are defined. </p>

<h3>Command: View</h3>
<p>Synopsis:</p> <pre><b> [View("</b><em>id</em><b>")]</b></pre>

<p>Executing this command will cause WinPCS to open a view on the object with the 
identity <em>id</em>. If the <em>id</em> contains spaces it must be enclosed in double quotes. 
WinPCS uses CORE to find this record, CXDICT to find the identifier field in the table and the menu 
setup in PCSD.INI to determine the INI file. For this command to work without any error 
messages, the CXDICT table must  contain the correct information.</p>

<hr/><a name="The.20Macros.20Topic"></a> <h2>The Macros Topic</h2> 

<p>This topic contains the following Items:</p>
<pre><b>Formats, TopicItemList, CommandList, Value </b></pre>
<p>and the following Commands:</p>
<pre><b> LoadMacro, Result, ClearMacro, Deletename, DoMacro </b></pre>

<h3>Item: Formats</h3>
<p>On Request, returns the supported formats in the WinPCS Macros topic. </p>

<h3>Item: TopicItemList</h3>
<p>On Request, returns the tab-separated list of items defined in the Macro Topic. </p>

<h3>Item: CommandList</h3>
<p>On Request, returns the tab-separated list of commands defined in the Macro Topic. </p>

<h3>Item: Value</h3>
<p>This is a test rabbit, no deposit no return. <br/>
On Request, a fixed Hello value <br/>
On Poke, a value to be shown on the debug terminal. <br/></p>

<h3>Command: [LoadMacro( )]</h3>
<p>Synopsis: </p><pre><b>[LoadMacro(</b><em>macrofile macrofile </em><b>... )]</b></pre>
<p>Will read and prescan one or more macro (LCX) files. The functions in these files may be 
referenced in subsequent calls to the <b>[DoMacro( )]</b> command. </p>

<p> Executing <b>[LoadMacro( )]</b> on already loaded macros will replace them, as if 
<b>[ClearMacro( )]</b> had been issued prior to the second <b>[LoadMacro( )]</b>.
Loaded macros will remain in place until they are replaced by another macro, removed 
with <b>[DeleteMacro( )]</b>, or WinPCS is terminated.</p>

<p> The macro files are to be given as full paths or with WinPCS's drive numbers, as per the 
<a href="#ExpandPath">ExpandPath( )</a> 
documentation. The 
backslashes (\) must be doubled up or they may be replaced by forward slashes (/). </p>

<h3>Command: [Result( )]</h3>
<p>Synopsis </p> <pre><b>[Result(</b><em>tempitemname</em><b>)]</b></pre>

<p>Creates an item named tempitemname, and places the DDE command execution result 
code of the next following DDE commands into it.  
Note that this is not the return value from the macro function, but status information 
indicating the success or failure to perform the command.
When this item is read through a DDE-request, the item's contents will be cleared and 
the next command's execution result will be placed into it.</p>

<h3>Command: [ClearMacro( )]</h3>
<p>Synopsis</p> <pre><b>[ClearMacro( )]</b></pre>
<p>Unload loaded macros, and deallocate the memory used. </p>

<h3>Command: [Deletename( )]</h3>
<p>Synopsis</p> <pre><b>[Deletename(</b><em>name</em><b>)]</b></pre>
<p>Removes the named item, created for a return value. </p>

<h3>Command: [DoMacro( )]</h3>
<p>Synopsis</p> <pre><b>[DoMacro(</b><em>retname, function, arg, arg, arg, ... </em><b>)]</b></pre>
<p>Execute a macro function with arguments specified, and add a DDE Item named 
after the string <em>retname</em>, which will contain the returned value from the macro function. </p>

<p> The system calls this macro function as</p>
<pre> function(arg, arg, arg, ... ) </pre>
<p>with as many arguments as passed into the execution of [DoMacro( )].</p>

<p> When the function (whose execution can take a while) returns, the returned value is 
made available through a Request on the <em>retname</em> item. </p>

<p> A second <b>DoMacro</b> to the same <em>retname</em> item will replace its contents, a <b>DoMacro</b> to a 
different <em>retname</em> item will create it and leave the previous <em>retname</em> item in place. To get 
rid of these generated items, the DDE command <b>[DeleteName(</b><em>name-to-be-deleted</em><b>)]</b>
should be used. </p>

<hr/><a name="DDE.20server.20example"></a> <h2>DDE server example</h2> 

<p>This uses the LCX standalone execution unit and the DDE client functions to interface to 
a WinPCS instance running as the server. </p>

<p> The function <b>main( )</b> below is the client function. The function <b>ddeset( )</b> is loaded and 
executed by the server. </p>

<pre>

/* DDE client side conversation. 
	Run this using the standalone LCX execution program, as
	WinPCS doesn't seem too good at being both a DDE client and DDE 
	server to itself.  

	Equivalent code would be in Excel or other programs that are able to run as DDE clients.
*/

main( )
{
    string hdde, t0, x;

    hdde = DDEconnect("WinPCS", "Macros");
    if(hdde == "0x0" )
    {
        message("WinPCS", "WinPCS could not be connected to ");
        return(0);
    }

    /* Load this macro file and prepare for running it. */
    x = DDEexecute(hdde, 
        "[LoadMacro(\x22 D:/winpcs/source/LCX97/TEST/DDE/DDE13.LCX\x22 )]");   

    /* Notice the x22s and the forward slashes to separate the path elements */

    /* Call a function named ddeset( ) with one argument, CWS, which presumably
	 is a system, and place the result in the DDE location SSS, as in SSS = ddeset("CWS") */

    x = DDEexecute(hdde, "[DoMacro(SSS, ddeset, \x22 CWS\x22 )]");

    /* Having run the macro, look at the return value that was put into SSS, and display it. */
    t0 = DDErequest(hdde, "SSS", 1);
    message("WinPCS DDE Server", "Value: ", t0);

    /* More functions may be run here, putting values into the same or different request locations. */

    /* After use, deallocate the data used for the macro and close the conversation. */ 
    
    x = DDEexecute(hdde, "[ClearMacro()]");

    DDEdisconnect(hdde);

    return(0);
}

</pre>

<p>The function <b>ddeset()</b> referred to in the file <b>DDE13.LCX</b> mentioned above is as follows:</p>

<p>This function runs on the WinPCS client side as the user who has logged into the running WinPCS instance,
so it looks like any other client-side job at that point.</p>

<pre>

ddeset(string system)
{
    string sz, j, count, ac1, sd, out;
	string ac1field, desfield;

	ac1field = StdField("CERTAC1", "ITEMFIELD");
	desfield = StdField("CERTAC1", "ITEMDESFIELD");

    sz = sortset(connset("CERTAC1", "CERTSYS", system), 0); 
    count = setlen(sz);
    out = "";
    for(j = 0; j &lt; count; j+=1)
    {
        ac1 = setitem(sz, j);
        findexact("CERTAC1", ac1field, ac1);
        sd = get("CERTAC1", desfield);
        out = concat(out, makeset(ac1, sd));  
    }
    return(out);
}

</pre>

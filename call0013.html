<h1>View SI Report Forall-Functions -- Category 13</h1> <p> 

<p>Functions called in this category are: </p>

<b>1.</b> Function called in response to the FORALL2 pushbutton defined in STATREES.INI or 
STAREP.INI SI report sections.<br/>
<b>2.</b> Function called in response to a FORALL2 pushbutton defined in an argument to
the <a href="lcxh.html#RepCreate">RepCreate( )</a> function.  <br/>
<b>3.</b> Function called in response to the FORALL or FORALL1 pushbuttons defined in 
STATREES.INI or STAREP.INI SI report sections. (16 bit only)<br/>

<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>These functions are called once per selected item in a Report View when the Forall 
button is hit.</p>

<h3>Enabling control in WinPCS:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Status Index Reports: FORALL2 buttons in STAREP.INI</li>
<li>Programmed reports: FORALL2 buttons defined in the 
<a href="lcxh.html#RepCreate ">RepCreate ( )</a> 
argument list, in tandem with a CS field definition. </li>
</ul>

<h3>FORALL series pushbuttons in SI and programmed reports.</h3>
<p>$select entries in STAREP.INI or CS fields in a Report, enable the 
selection column in the Report View. Execution is done on all records in the Report View where 
the value is the Yes-value defined. The $select= controls in STATREES.INI appear in the 
sections dealing with SI report layout is defined as one of the following:</p>

<p>
$select icon legend = width (field-legend) I:1 yes no <br/>
$select icon legend = width (field-legend) I:2 yes no <br/>
$select icon legend = width (field-legend) I:3 yes no table field function<br/>
</p>
<p>See the documentation for
<a href="lcxh.html#RepCreate">RepCreate( )</a> 
for the equivalent CS field definition in the Programmed (non-status-index) Reports</p>

<p>The I:1 makes the initial setting to the no-value, I:2 defaults similarly to the yes value, 
and I:3 allows a defined macro function to return the yes or no value as appropriate. 
This macro function works like all the 
<a href="call3209.html"> other field-data functions in category 9</a>. 
</p>

<p>The associated buttons are then defined as:<br/>
$button legend = FORALL odraw (Explanation) function<br/>
$button legend = FORALL1 odraw (Explanation) function<br/>
$button legend = FORALL2 odraw (Explanation) function<br/>
$button legend = FORALL2 odraw (Explanation) file function<br/>
</p>

<p>Note that only FORALL2 is still implemented in the 32-bit and 64-bit systems. 
FORALL was too hard to maintain, and FORALL1 is redundant.</p>

<p>The legend parameter is the legend on the button if odraw is 0 or the name of the bitmap 
on the button if odraw is 1. This is expected to match the legend name in the $select 
entries.</p>

<p>For example, the following entries will generate a field filled with N for not selected and Y 
for selected, and the field will be 10 wide, with the icon defined in REFBMP as lilprint 
and titled Print Y/N. The function LCX_Certs_Print(&nbsp;) will be invoked for all the records 
selected (the ones with the Y) in this field. </p>

<pre>
$select lilprint PCert=5 (Print Y/N) I:2 Y N
$button PCert=FORALL2 0 (Print Selected Records) LCX_Certs_Print
</pre>

<h3>Disallowed functions:</h3>
<p>DDE callback and document-drawing functions are only available inside the DDE 
callback and Printing callback environments.  There is however no restrictions on 
initiating printing or DDE-operations. This is actually one of the major uses of these
functions: to cause printing of all check-sheets or punchitems in a report.</p>

<h3>LCX files (16-bit):</h3>
<p>All LCX functions referred to in STATREES.INI or STAREP.INI [SI] sections are expected to be found in 
one of the files referred to via SI= in the [RCONN] section in WinPCS.ini</p>

<h3>LCX files (32-bit):</h3>
<p>In the case of FORALL2, if the first space-separated word following the end of the explanation
contains any of the characters :, /, \, and . this will be taken as the name of the file where the
function is expected to be found. Otherwise, all pushbutton LCX functions referred to in STATREES.INI or 
STAREP.INI [SI] sections are expected to be found in one of the files referred to via SI= in the [LCX] section 
in client.ini. Field-functions will be expected to be found on the server, as discussed in
<a href="call3209.html"> Status Index Callback field functions</a>
The situation is similar to the optional file-name defined for
the <a href="call3206.html#Cat6432"> LCXCALL buttons in Reports.  </a>
</p>

<h3>Callback functions:</h3>
<p><b>FORALL:</b>
<em>function</em><b>(</b><em>field1</em><b>, </b><em>field2</em><b>, ...)</b></p>

<p> The 
<em>field1</em>, <em>field1</em> etc., are the data in the row of the report, as defined 
in STATREES.INI.  This function's argument set makes it very hard to maintain, since it depends 
so strongly on the presence and order of the fields in the report. The function has therefore not 
been ported from the 16-bit monolithic systems to the 32-bit system. 
</p>

<p><b>FORALL1:</b></p>
<p><em>function</em><b>(</b><em>reportID</em><b>, </b><em>row</em><b>, </b><em>turn</em><b>, 
</b><em>yescount</em><b>, </b><em>nocount</em><b>)</b></p>

<p>This <em>function</em> is called once for each record with <b>Yes</b> in the Yes/No field. 
The arguments are as explained below with FORALL2. It does not have an initial checking pass, 
and has been deemed redundant, since FORALL2 where this initial pass is ignored is functionally
exactly the same. </p>


<p><b>FORALL2:</b></p>

<p>Initial call: <em>checkvalue</em> = <em>function</em><b>(</b><em>reportID</em><b>, -1, -1, 
</b><em>yescount</em><b>, </b><em>nocount</em><b>)</b></p>

<p>This is called even if there are no Yes records.
The argument <em>reportID</em> refers to the report. Functions
such as <a href="lcxh.html#RepInfo">RepInfo(&nbsp;)</a> can be used to find out more about the report; 
notably how many records and fields there are, as well as parameters and field aliases set in its layout.</p>

<p>The <em>yescount</em> is the number of records with Yes in the Yes/No field, and 
<em>nocount</em> is the number of records with No in the Yes/No field. The function is called this
first exploratory pass even if there are no records with Yes, in which case the value of <em>yescount</em> is zero. </p>

<p>Any global variables set in this initial pass will retain their values during subsequent passes.</p>

<p>If this initial call returns a numeric value greater than or equal to zero, the calls are then
made for each of the records with the Yes value in their Yes/No field:</p>

<p>Subsequent calls: <em>function</em><b>(</b><em>reportID</em><b>, </b><em>row</em><b>, </b><em>turn</em><b>, 
</b><em>yescount</em><b>, </b><em>nocount</em><b>)</b></p>

<p><em>reportID</em>, <em>yescount</em>, and <em>nocount</em> are the same as on the first call. <em>turn</em>
is a counter starting at 0, it is incremented by 1 for each pass; so eventually it will reach the value 
of <em>yescount</em>-1,  <em>row</em> is the zero-based row number indicating the record in the report
that is being processed.  In order to be used with 
<a href="lcxh.html#RepGet">RepGet(&nbsp;)</a> or <a href="lcxh.html#RepPut">RepPut(&nbsp;)</a>
which use negative numbers based on the end of the report, 
it has to be adjusted with the number of records in the report, highlighted in the following: </p>

<pre>
LCX_Certs_Print(string reportID, string row, string turn, string yescount, string nocount)
{
	string <b>rmax</b>, tagno, tagcolumn;

	/* the report has a defined alias, tagno, defined for the field containing an equipment tag number */

	<b>rmax</b> = RepInfo("rows", reportID);

	tagcolumn = RepInfo("alias tagno", reportID);

	tagno = RepGet(row<b>-rmax</b>, tagcolumn, reportID);

	/* do something interesting with this ... */

	return(0);
}
</pre>

<h3>Return Value: (initial pass)</h3>
<p>The FORALL2 function should return:<br/>
Return 0 or a positive value to continue with the first record marked Yes.<br/>
Return -3 or another negative value for stopping the processing. <br/>

<h3>Return Value: (subsequent pass)</h3>
<p>The FORALL2 function should return:<br/>
Return 1 for turning the status back to No<br/>
Return 0 for leaving the status at Yes<br/>
Return -1 to ask the user if he wants to retry the most recent one, or cancel the sequence.<br/>
Return -2 to ask the user if he wants to try the next one, or cancel the sequence.<br/>
Return -3 to break off the loop prematurely.</p>

<h3>Execution context:</h3>
<p>Not shared.  Re-entered: The function is called once per selected record in the Report.</p>

<h2>1. LCXCALL and LCXCALLA pushbuttons in View and Entry</h2>

<h3>Enabling control in WinPCS: </h3>
<p> The <a href="evini.html#PushCommand">LCXCALL</a>
definition for a pushbutton in 
The <a href="evini.html"> View .INI, Entry .INI files </a>
and the common pushbuttons in the <b>0:\VIEW.INI</b> file. </p>

<p>There is one call per push.</p>

<p>The LCXCALL and LCXCALLA  definitions in all of these .INI files is on
one of the following forms:</p>
<pre>
<em>Legend</em><b>=LCXCALL 1 (</b><em>explanation</em><b>)</b><em> filename function tailarg ... </em>
<em>Legend</em><b>=LCXCALLA 1 (</b><em>explanation</em><b>)</b><em> filename function tailarg ... </em>
<em>Text</em><b>=LCXCALL 0 (</b><em>explanation</em><b>)</b><em> filename function tailarg ... </em>
<em>Text</em><b>=LCXCALLA 0 (</b><em>explanation</em><b>)</b><em> filename function tailarg ... </em>
</pre>

<h3>LCX files and Callback function for View .INI files:</h3>
<p>The filename and function name is referred to in the 
button definition in the View .INI file.</p>

<h3>Calling sequence:</h3>
<p>(source reference eview/evpush.c)</p>
<p>The function is called as :</p>
<pre>
<em>function</em><b>(</b><em>view</em><b>, </b><em>base</em><b>, </b><em>item</em><b>, </b><em>tailarg ... </em><b>)</b>
</pre>

<p>where <em>view</em> indicates where the call originated, 
the <em>base</em> is the name of the table of that View or Entry panel, and
the <em>item</em> is the name of the object being shown in the View or 
Entry, as per the CXDICT ITEMFLD value. 
The <em>tailarg</em> arguments correspond to the words on the rest of 
the line in the definition. This is often used for additional fieldnames. </p>

<h3>Return value:</h3>
<p>The function should return a 3-part set, where the first 
element is 0 for status OK resulting in a green 
status button and non-0 for status error, resulting in a red status button.
The second element is an explanatory text to go into the action status list, 
and the last element indicates whether the view itself should be 
updated or not.  </p>

<p>For example, if the macro-function does something that changes the values in the displayed record in the table,
it is likely that an update of the visuals will be desired. The typical return statement would then be something
along the lines of:</p>

<pre><b>return(makeset(0, "OK", 1));</b></pre>


<h3>Note:</h3>
<p>Although the name and the general definition is nearly the same as 
<a href="#Cat6432"> LCXCALL buttons in Reports</a>, their calling
contexts and argument lists are different. Views and Entries have a welldefined, single table and
record, while a Report is a list of records with a lot more possible variations.</p>

<h2>2. $LCXMACRO() on View or Entry fields </h2>

<p>See also the reference to the <a href="evini.html#LCXMACRO">$LCXMACRO</a> command.</p>

<h3>The Entry or View INI file entry:</h3>

<pre> fieldname=order size 0 case (description) $LCXMACRO(function, param, reserved, legend) </pre>

<p>for example</p>
<pre>    SITE=25 2 0 L (Sitecode) $LCXMACRO(ValSite, F101, 0, Site OK)</pre>

<h3>Function </h3>
<p>The function is then called as</p>

<pre>function(table, field, screenvalue, param, opcode, univalue);</pre>

<p>and should return a 3-part set as:</p>

<pre> makeset(rcode, primary, secondary)</pre>

<h3>Function arguments and return value</h3>
<p>(source reference eview/macval.c)</p>

<p>The function parameters are:<br/>
<em>table</em> is the table being looked at in Entry; <br/>
<em>field</em> is the field where the $LCXMACRO operation is placed;<br/>
<em>screenvalue</em> is the value of this field on-screen before coming 
into the function;<br/>
<em>param</em> is the parameter copied verbatim from the second 
parameter of the $LCXMACRO<br/> 
<em>opcode</em> is either INFO or VALIDATION according to the 
reason for the function being called. More on this below.<br/>
<em>univalue</em> is the value of the field name specified as ITEMUNIFLD 
in CXDICT for this table. It is normally the record number. Its main 
purpose is to allow the macro user to position on the current record 
of the table being edited, if necessary. More on this below.<br/>
</p>

<h3>Return value</h3>
<p>For the returned value, the three parts of the set are:<br/>
<em>rcode</em>. To be given one of the values <b>-1</b>, <b>0</b>, or <b>1</b> 
as per the following, dependent on the value of <em>opcode</em><br/>
<em>primary</em>: Value of the primary field on-screen<br/>
<em>secondary</em>: Value of the secondary field on-screen.</p>

<h4>For both <em>opcode</em> == INFO and <em>opcode</em> == VALIDATE:</h4>

<p>Set rcode to <b>-1</b> when: The macro function could not decide whether 
the value of the <em>screenvalue</em> was good or bad.  This is also the value 
to use if the value is bad and the macro function decides it can't 
be fixed, or some secondary error occurred.</p>

<h4>For opcode == INFO:</h4>
<p> Set <em>rcode</em> to <b>0</b> in order to cause a subsequent 
validation to be done. </p>
<p>Set <em>rcode</em> to <b>1</b> means: Do not cause a subsequent 
validation call; the <em>screenvalue</em> is deemed to be OK as is. Pass the 
<em>screenvalue</em> back as the primary field parameter, possibly with 
simple changes (spaces removed, upper-case conversion, that sort of thing).</p>

<h4>For opcode == VALIDATE</h4>
<p>Set <em>rcode</em> to <b>0</b> in order to reject the value.</p>
<p>Set <em>rcode</em> to <b>1</b> in order to accept the value, 
similar to INFO.</p>

<h3>Files</h3>
<p>The function is expected to be in the file specified in <b>WinPCS.INI</b>, 
the <b>[ENTRY]</b> section, <b>LCXFILES=</b> entry; or if this is absent, the file 
<b>0:\ENTRY.LCX</b> (in the client system directory where <b>ANCHORC.DLL</b> 
and <b>WinPCS.INI</b> are). Even when used in Views in 32-bit 
systems, the default file is still <b>0:\ENTRY.LCX</b>, and these files are
still referenced in the <b>[ENTRY]</b> section. </p>

<h3>Availability:</h3>
<p>When this field is part of a Quick Report, the LCX code is copied from the client 
for the occasion and then run on the server: this is one of the few places where 
the same LCX code regularly is run on both the client and on the server.</p>

<p>Therefore, some caution is advised in calling only those system functions that
exist on both server and client. </p>

<h3>Order of calls:</h3>
<p>The function is used for both info and validation. The purpose of the 
info call <b>("INFO"==opcode)</b> is twofold: (1) place values onto the screen 
and (2) indicate whether subsequent validation is needed. 
The validation call <b>("VALIDATE"==opcode)</b> is expected to perform 
the validation itself.  The outcome of this is accept or reject accordingly. 
If desired, the info or validation calls may place a value in 
the  secondary field on the screen.</p>

<p>Info calls are made when:</p>
<p>- Entry or view is started, in order to place any initial values on 
the screen, different from the ones in the table.</p>
<p>- Return is hit on a field with a $LCXMACRO setting.</p>
<p>- When a report containing this field is run, the function is run
as an INFO call on the server. </p>

<p>The Validate calls are made when:</p>
<p>- Return is hit on a field with a <b>$LCXMACRO</b> setting, and the 
corresponding info call has returned 0. </p>
<p>- the Validate button is clicked and the current field has the <b>$LCXMACRO</b> 
defined. There is no prior info call for this, as the pushing of the 
Validate button is equivalent to an info function
returning the value 0 for Validation required.  </p>

<h3>More Notes:</h3>
<p>Although designed for validation, this may be used for other purposes 
as well. For example, when a specific value is entered into a field, a 
subsequent operation is to be done (create a record, make a connection, 
verify the presence or absence of something, etc.)  Of course, this 
may be called validation in a wider sense. The way to do this is to let 
the info function return <b>0</b> and the original primary value (and any 
desired secondary value; but note that secondary values don't get stored 
anywhere) The validation function then does whatever it wants and 
returns the desired values and <b>1</b> to accept. If the external function 
failed, the validation function may return <b>0</b> to forestall 
any updating or insertion of the main table.</p>

<h3>Example:</h3>
<p>If a field has the value <b>"Y"</b> upon validation, perform an unspecified 
task. If the field does not have value <b>"Y"</b>, do nothing.</p>

<p>In the Entry INI file: </p>

    <pre>REQUIRED=25 2 0 L (Required action) $LCXMACRO(ReqVal, Y)</pre>

<p>The Macro function will then look like:</p>

<pre>
ReqVal(string table, string field, string screenvalue, 
    string param, string opcode, string univalue)
{
    string sfield;

    if("INFO" == opcode)
    {
        /* Cause all subsequent validation actions to be performed. */
        return(makeset(0, screenvalue, "" ));
    }

    if("Y" == screenvalue)
    {
        /* This shows how to position the table so get() will work properly. */
        sfield = StdField(table, "ITEMUNIFLD");
        findexact(table, sfield, univalue);

        /* Do the desired actions. */

        /* ... */
    }
    return(makeset(1, screenvalue, "" ));
}
</pre>

<h2>3. Menu choice System/Run Macro</h2>

<h3>Enabling control in WinPCS: </h3>
<p><em>System/Run Macro</em> menu command</p>

<p>The user selects the macro file and function in the following 
dialogs. There are no arguments, and the return value is ignored.</p>

<h2>4. LCXCALL in Reports </h2>

<h3>Enabling control in WinPCS:</h3>
<p>The <b>LCXCALL</b> definition in <b>STAREP.INI</b> Report sections. <br/>
The <b>LCXCALL</b> pushbutton definition in a report created with 
<a href="lcxh.html#RepCreate">RepCreate( )</a> 
</p>

<p>The definitions in STAREP.INI or the 
<a href="lcxh.html#RepCreate">RepCreate( )</a> argument list is one of </p>
<pre>
<b>$button </b><em>icon</em><b>=LCXCALL 1 (</b><em>Explanation</em><b>)</b><em> function optional tail-args</em>
<b>$button </b><em>legend</em><b>=LCXCALL 0 (</b><em>Explanation</em><b>)</b><em> function optional tail-args</em>
<b>makeset("PB", </b><em>icon</em><b>, "LCXCALL 1 (</b><em>Explanation</em><b>)</b><em> file function optional tail-args</em><b>")</b>
<b>makeset("PB", </b><em>legend</em><b>, "LCXCALL 0 (</b><em>Explanation</em><b>)</b><em> file function optional tail-args</em><b>")</b>
</pre>
<p>and when the button is pushed, the call takes place as</p>
<pre>
<em> function</em><b>(</b><em>optional tail-args</em><b>,</b><em>Report</em><b>)</b>
</pre>

<p>
<em>icon</em> is the name of a bitmap to appear on the pushbutton instead of a legend<br/>
<em>legend</em> is the text to appear on the pushbutton instead of a bitmap<br/>
<em>Explanation</em> is the text to appear explaining the purpose of the pushbutton.<br/>
<em>optional tail-args</em> is any trailing text following the functin name.
It is frequently useful to formulate this as a set or a separatable list, since the entire
rest of the line is passed in as one argument.  <br/>
<em>Report</em> is the reference to the report where this pushbutton is defined. This parameter
is used with functions such as <a href="lcxh.html#RepInfo">RepInfo( )</a> and 
<a href="lcxh.html#RepGet">RepGet( )</a> functions to read the contents of the report. 
</p>

<h3>Example:</h3>
<pre>
$button LCX=LCXCALL 0 (Do something) RunLoop 5,4,2
</pre>
<p>where the function RunLoop( ), which presumably wants three column-indexes as the argument, 
and does something interesting but unspecified with the data in the report, looks something like:</p>
<pre>
RunLoop(string tail, string Report)
{
	string rcount, row, cset; 
	string tagcol, descrcol, statuscol;
	string tag, descr, status;

	/* Convert the comma-separated list into a regular set, then extract the column numbers. */ 
	cset = tabtoset(tail, ordinal(",") ); 
	tagcol = setiem(cset, 0); 
	descrcol = setiem(cset, 1); 
	statuscol = setiem(cset, 2); 

	rcount = RepInfo("rows", Report); 
	/* Note that row numbering starts at -(row count) and goes up to -1.  */ 
	for(row = -rcount; row &lt; 0; row += 1)
	{
		tag = RepGet(row, tagcol, Report); 
		descr = RepGet(row, descrcol, Report); 
		status = RepGet(row, statuscol, Report); 

		if("OK" == status)
		{
			/* Do whatever is desired with the tags that are OK 
				... 
			*/ 
		}
	}
    return(0);
}
</pre>

<h3>Special replacements:</h3>
<p>None. If the function is non-existent either an error message will appear in its place, 
	or nothing at all will happen. 
Use <a href="lcxh.html#message">message( )</a> for debugging and finding out why nothing appears.</p>

<h3>Note:</h3>
<p>Although the name and the general definition is nearly the same as 
<a href="#Cat6132"> LCXCALL buttons in Views</a>, their calling
contexts and argument lists are different. Reports allow for a lot more variations
than the Views and Entries with their welldefined, single table and
record.</p>

<h3>Execution context:</h3>
<p>Not shared and not re-entered.</p>

<h2>5. Menu entry with L or La action code</h2>

<h3>Enabling control in WinPCS: </h3>
<p>Entry in PCSD.INI with the <b>L</b> (synchronous LCX) or <b>La</b> 
(asynchronous LCX) operation code, indicating a macrofunction to be run in 
response to selecting the menu entry. 
The <b>La</b> code starts the macrofunction in a new thread, this 
can be useful for reports that call the server and end up sitting 
and waiting for data from it.  Such reports are very user-unfriendly 
when run in synchronous mode. </p>

<p>These entries are on one of the forms:<br/>
<em>Menu text</em><b>=</b><em>lcxfile</em><b> L </b><em>function</em><br/>
<em>Menu text</em><b>=</b><em>lcxfile</em><b> La </b><em>function</em><br/>
<em>Menu text</em><b>=</b><em>lcxfile</em><b> L(</b><em>symbol</em><b>) </b><em>function</em><br/>
<em>Menu text</em><b>=</b><em>lcxfile</em><b> La(</b><em>symbol</em><b>) </b><em>function</em><br/>
where the <em>Menu text</em> is the string appearing in the menu, 
<em>lcxfile</em> is the file where the <em>function</em> is expected
to be found. The optional <em>symbol</em> is a bitmap or icon defined in
REFBMP31.INI that can accompany the text in the menu entry. </p>

<p>In addition to the file shown, functions defined in the files
listed in WinPCS.INI, section [WINPCS] entry LIBRARY= are available.</p>

<p>There must be a R or A permission setting on an entry 
<b>L</b><em>lcxfile</em> defined in USYM and WUSER. If there is
no such entry, or the permission-setting is H, the menu item 
will appear grayed and be unavailable.</p>

<h3>Calling sequence:</h3>
<p>(source reference winpcs31/dispatch.c)</p>
<p>The function is called with 4 arguments, as :</p>
<pre>
<em>function</em><b>(</b><em>""</em><b>, </b><em>""</em><b>, </b><em>permission</em><b>, </b><em>tailarg</em><b>)</b>
</pre>
<p>Its return value is ignored. </p>
<p>The first two arguments are blank, this is from compatibility with
old 16-bit systems. The tail arguments all come in one string, no effort is
spent on chopping this into words. 
Use <a href="lcxh.html#strword">strword( )</a> 
to do that as and when necessary. </p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>These are some typical references from various sections in PCSD.INI:</p>

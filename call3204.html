<h1>Make and Break -- Category 4 (32-bit WinPCS)</h1>

<h3>Enabling controls</h3>
<p>Function calls in this category are made when an item is 
connected to or disconnected from another item, and there 
is a reference to a function to be called in the process. If no
function is specified, no extra action will take place.</p>

<p>The call for Make takes place immediately prior to the Insert action for the connection table,
and the main purpose of it is to allow additional initial values to go into the table. 
Common items are initial status values, creation dates, and user-identities.</p>

<p>The call for Break takes place immediately prior to the Delete action for the
connection table.  Its purpose could typically be to forestall a disconnection, or make sure that
other related items in other tables, such as references, are updated. </p>

<p>These functions are specified in the following places:</p>

<p>
<b>1.</b> Table <b>RCONN</b>, field <b>ONMAKE</b> or 
<b>ONBREAK</b> for the defining record</p>

<p>
<b>2.</b> File <b>SERVER.INI</b> section <b>[RCONN]</b> 
entry <b>MAKECONTROL=</b> or <b>BREAKCONTROL=</b></p>

<p>If the <b>ONMAKE</b> or <b>ONBREAK</b> fields are blank for any specific connection,
the functions mentioned in the entries <b>MAKECONTROL=</b> and <b>BREAKCONTROL=</b>, as per no. 2 above, are used instead. 
Since these are global, they apply to all connections.  </p>

<p>The fields <b>ONMAKEMODE</b> and <b>ONBREAKMODE</b> in <b>RCONN</b> 
are used to determine whether the make- or break-functions are to be called
on the server side or on the client side. This applies to any function 
specified, whether individual functions as per no.1 or global functions as per no.2 above. </p>

<p>The value <b>C</b> for 
<b>ONMAKEMODE</b> and <b>ONBREAKMODE</b>
here means the corresponding function should run on 
the client. Other values means it will
run on the Server; it is recommended that an <b>S</b> be put in here to
emphasize this. For development and testing purposes, the Client-side
ONMAKEMODE/ONBREAKMODE may be used with the 
<a href="lcxh.html#Functions.20available.20with.20the.2032.2dbit.20Server"> 
Server-side functions (32s) </a> functions and
<a href="lcxh.html#message">message( )</a>, then when there is no more need 
for debugging and messaging, the code and the 
ONMAKEMODE/ONBREAKMODE may be moved to Server-side.  </p>

<p>It should be noticed that having call-back functions on the client makes
it impossible to perform efficient gang-connect or gang-disconnect, since these
depend on the server being able to perform many connections or disconnections
without any interaction. Having to stop and check for these functions on the 
client does not work very well over WANs or long-haul connections. If at all
possible, therefore, the callback-functions should be done on the server-side.
Any messages needed to be passed to the client, in order to explain to the user
why the connection or disconnection attempt failed, can be generated in the callback
function and returned as the second part of the return value.  </p>


<p>In most cases, these functions and modes will have to be the same for 
both records in the pair defining the connection. There is room for making
these slightly different however, for example, a warning message (for client
side action) may be desired for connections in the one direction but not the
other. However, any actions preparing the connection table record or any
additional tables generally must be performed in both directions. </p>

<p>Of course, the mode for Make can be different from the mode for Break. </p>

<h3>Difference from 16-bit:</h3>
<p>Functions have more arguments, 5 instead of 3. These are still 
Item and Rel identified, not Left and Right, since although commonly 
used, the LEFT and RIGHT notation is merely a convention, not any 
hardcoded field-name.  If someone wanted to call them THIS and THAT,
they could, and as long as the fieldnames referenced in RCONN 
are modified accordingly, this would work. </p>

<p>There are no functions referenced for make and break in STADLG.INI 
on 32-bit systems.  Any such references there are ignored.  The file 
where the functions are expected to be should be one of the ones 
referenced in the 
file <b>SERVER.INI</b> section <b>[LCX]</b> entry <b>FILES=</b> 
there.  These files contain all macro functions to be used by the server. </p>

<h3>Disallowed functions:</h3>
<p>DDE callback and document-drawing functions are only available inside the DDE 
callback and Printing callback environments.  </p>

<p>When these functions run on the server, there will not
be any place to emit any output or message boxes. Only the functions 
marked as 
<a href="lcxh.html#Functions.20available.20with.20the.2032.2dbit.20Server">
32s (Functions available with the 32-bit server) </a>
are available in this case. For client-side calls, all the 
<a href="lcxh.html#Functions.20available.20with.20the.2032.2dbit.20client">
32c (Functions available with the 32-bit client) </a>
functions may be used, subject to reasonable limitations.</p>

<p>When the make- or break- activities are to be performed on the server, 
no client-mode functions can be called. The behavior during make or break
activities is not defined in these cases.  It is therefore recommended to 
put these functions on the server if at all possible. </p>

<h3>Functions that are not recommended:</h3>
<p>Since make and break operations may occur in a noninteractive 
context, for example with Gang Connect or Gang Disconnect, 
they should not normally  contain calls to functions that require user 
interaction, such as 
<a href="lcxh.html#message">message( )</a> or 
<a href="lcxh.html#input">input( )</a>. These functions are obviously
OK for development and trace printing purposes, however.  For the 
same reason, the DDE-initiating, 
status index dialog, and certificate functions do not make much sense either.</p>

<p>Further calls to connect or disconnect the same kind of 
objects must not be attempted either; 
since this can cause an infinite recursion and eventually a crash. </p>

<p>Also note that the client-side callback functions can be a cause of 
inefficiencies with Gang Connect and Gang Disconnect. Use the return value
option from a server-side function instead, if at all possible.</p>

<h3>LCX files:</h3>
<p>Server-side functions are expected to be found in the files referenced in 
<b>SERVER.INI</b> section <b>[LCX]</b> entry <b>FILES=</b> there. </p>

<p>Similarly, Client-side functions are expected to be found in the files
reference in <b>WINPCS.INI</b> section <b>[RCONN]</b> 
entry <b>FILES=</b> there. </p>

<p>It is possible to co-locate these files, however, this does not fit
well with operations on wide-area networks and is therefore not really 
a good idea.</p>

<h3>Callback functions:</h3>
<pre><em>code</em><b> = </b><em>makefunction</em><b>(</b><em>Conbase</em><b>, </b><em>relbase</em><b>, </b><em>itembase</em><b>, </b><em>itemID</em><b>, </b><em>relID</em><b>, </b><em>parameter</em><b>)</b>
<em>code</em><b> = </b><em>breakfunction</em><b>(</b><em>Conbase</em><b>, </b><em>relbase</em><b>, </b><em>itembase</em><b>, </b><em>itemID</em><b>, </b><em>relID</em><b>)</b>
</pre>

<h3>Arguments:</h3>
<p><em>relbase</em> and <em>itembase</em> are the names of the two tables 
to be connected.  The connection between them is the <em>Conbase</em>. 
itemID and relID are the identities (CXDICTs or RCONNs ITEMFLD) of the objects
in these two tables. </p>

<p>On entry to the function, the itembase and relbase will be positioned on the records 
corresponding to the objects being connected or disconnected, as they are known as itemID and relID.  </p>

<p>For Make, the Conbase will have the candidate data in its record for 
the itemID-relID connection about to be made. The values in the various 
fields here may be examined using 
<a href="lcxh.html#get"> get( )</a> and changed using
<a href="lcxh.html#put"> put( )</a>
in the usual way. Once the makefunction returns with a "proceed" code, 
the connection will be established by the system. Note that repositioning 
the connection-table will invalidate the
connection-record and will result in the connection attempt failing.</p>

<p>The <em>parameter</em> is the value that was passed in as the 
5th argument to the <a href="lcxh.html#connect">connect( )</a>  function. 
This can be omitted if it is not of interest. It will be blank if not passed
in the <a href="lcxh.html#connect">connect( )</a> call. </p> 

<p>For the Break function, the Conbase will be positioned on the record 
about to be deleted.  Repositioning the record of this table is OK, 
since its position will be re-established prior to the deletion.</p>

<h3>Current records:</h3>
<p>RCONN is positioned on the records where its fields OPERATION and 
ITEMBASE match the two tables being connected. The two connectee tables 
(RCONNs ITEMBASE and RELBASE) are 
positioned on their respective records, and the connection 
table's current record is the one about to be deleted on break, 
or the data to be put into the new record on make. Note that if this
table is repositioned during the make-function the proposed information
could be lost. To avoid this, there are special functions that allow
access to a copy of this record.</p>

<h3>Special functions:</h3>
<p>There are two functions that may be used for the Make callback on the client side. These
access the potentially inserted record in the connection-table, and allows reading and
writing this, similar to using the <a href="lcxh.html#put">put( )</a> or <a href="lcxh.html#get">get( )</a> 
functions. The difference is that there can be repositioning of the connection table, but the
actual, not-yet-existing record to be inserted would then be lost and cannot be retrieved. The
effect would be to have things connected wrongly. With other connection technologies than RCONN, 
there might not even be a separarate table or record to access via 
<a href="lcxh.html#put">put( )</a> or <a href="lcxh.html#get">get( )</a>, in these cases, using 
<a href="lcxh.html#InValue">InValue( )</a> or <a href="lcxh.html#OutValue">OutValue( )</a> will be mandatory.  </p>

<p>
<b>InValue(field )</b><br/>
This returns the value of the specified field in the proposed record to be created as a
consequence of making this connection.  This may not always be a real record, but the net
effect will be to have read the value as it applies to this connection instance.</p>

<p>
<b>OutValue(field, value) </b><br/>
This places the selected value to a specified field in the proposed record to be created
as the consequence of making this connection, or a property of the object created. </p>

<h3>Return Value:</h3>
<p>The return value can be a single value or a 2-part set, where the single value or the
first part of the set are as follows:</p>

<p> <b>0</b> for OK, the system should proceed to make (Insert) or break (Delete) the connection.</p>

<p> <b>-1</b> for indicating that the callback function did the make 
or break action and the system should not
perform the Insert or Delete action again. This may also be used for 
quiet failures. The second part of the set can be a message which
is added to the returned message about the status.  </p>

<p> <b>-2</b> for fail with an error message. 
Connections are not changed (made or broken) by the system if 
the return value is negative.  The second part of the set can 
be a message which is added to the returned message about the failure.  
</p>

<h3>Special replacements:</h3>
<p>
<b>NOOP</b> which is the same as a blank value <br/>
<b>DISALLOW</b><br/></p>

<h3>Execution context:</h3>
<p>Not shared and not re-entered. The execution context on a client is
different from the one where the 
<a href="lcxh.html#connect"> connect() </a> function itself is called.</p>

<p>When the execution context is on the server no message boxes 
or dialogs can be opened there.</p>

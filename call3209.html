<h1>Status Index Callback -- Category 9 (32-bit WinPCS)</h1> <p> 

<h3>Enabling control in WinPCS:</h3>
Function calls in this category are made when an operation function is defined in 
STATREES.INI or STAREP.INI for a field in a SI report.  The function is called once per record where the 
tree is complete, i.e. when a leaf record exists.  Calls are not made on records where 
the leaves are missing.

<h3>Disallowed functions:</h3>
Since these functions run on the server while the report is being assembled, only the 
<a href="lcxh.html#Functions.20available.20with.20the.2032.2dbit.20Server"> 
functions defined on the server </a> may be used. 

<p>This excludes all functions requiring user interaction. To print messages for debugging, 
use trace() or print(), or put out the messages as part of the function's return value.. 

<h3>LCX files:</h3>
Server-side functions are expected to be found in the files referenced in 
<b>SERVER.INI</b> section <b>[LCX]</b> entry <b>FILES=</b> there.  

<h3>Callback function:</h3>
<p>(Ref: sirep/xsrun.c(1025))</p>
<pre><em>value_to_appear_in_field</em><b> = </b><em>function</em><b>(</b><em>value_found_in_field</em><b>, </b><em>treeline</em><b>, </b><em>rootitem</em><b>, </b><em>dataset</em><b>, </b><em>columnindex</em><b>)</b></pre>

<p>The <em>value_found_in_field</em> is the inbound value coming from the field specified in the report. 
This is often the RSERIAL or #ITEMFLD of some object of interest when the output of the function is 
something related to this, but not merely the name. Typical examples are functions that list and count
related objects such as punchitems or checksheets.</p>

<p>The <em>treeline</em> is a set containing all the tables in the tree-line being used at the moment. 
The last name in this set is the leaf, and the second to last name in this set is the penultimate level, 
corresponding to <b>#LEAF</b> and <b>#PENULT</b>.  </p>

<p>The <em>rootitem</em> is the name of the object that the report is started on.</p>

<p>The next argument, <em>dataset</em>,  is a reference to the status index report. This is used with the 
<a href="lcxh.html#SIRepGet">SIRepGet( )</a> and <a href="lcxh.html#SIRepPut">SIRepPut( )</a> 
functions to look at and change earlier values in the same record.  This value can also be used as the report-identifier argument in functions such as
<a href="lcxh.html#RepInfo">RepInfo( )</a> 
to obtain parameter or legend string values. </p>

<p>The last argument, <em>columnindex</em> refers to the positional index of the field in the report.</p>

<p>The value of the incoming <em>value_found_in_field</em> argument and the function's return value need 
not have any  logical connection whatever, the report will reflect whatever data the function returns. 
This can be exploited for debugging purposes.</p>

<p>The functions <a href="lcxh.html#SIRepGet">SIRepGet( )</a> and <a href="lcxh.html#SIRepPut">SIRepPut( )</a> 
can be used to examine the data in other fields in this record.  Note that only fields in the same record
and to the left of the field being assembled can be accessed this way. It may be better to use 
the before- and after-functions rather than on-field functions for editing entire records.  Reading fields 
in columns numbered <em>columnindex</em> or higher will return blanks, and values written to such other 
fields will be overwritten later when this field is populated. </p>

<h3>Execution context:</h3>
<p>This is reentered, so global variables set up on one early field may be reused in another field.
Frequently the value to appear in one field is the result of some complex action which 
produces values to go into several other fields, and by storing these in global variables
a lot of processing time is saved. </p>

<p>This is also shared with "Category 12 -- View report before/after functions" and thus
this Before-function may set up reference globals for the field-functions to use. </p>

<hr/>
<h1>The WUSER (USER) and USYM tables</h1>

<p>The WUSER (USER) table lists the defined users that can log-in into 
WinPCS. 
This table is named WUSER in SQL -based systems, 
since USER is a reserved keyword there. 
</p>

<p>Permissions are stored in the field named MATRIX in this table,
where each position after the first one is a letter indicating
one of three possible levels of access, basically:</p>

<ul>
<li>A - All rights - the user has full read/write access to this element</li>
<li>R - Read-only - the user can see, but not change the element</li>
<li>H - Hidden - the user cannot even see the element.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a number of exceptions to the above, mostly that A and R means
the same thing, that something is visible and available, and H 
means it is invisible or unavailable.  The default state 
when no USYM record is
defined is also different between various kinds of elements;
Status and connection controls default to A but the menu entries 
of Views, Entry, and LCX files default to H.  </p>

<p>The definitions of what these elements are is in the USYM table.  
The table has a field VIEWSEQ that indexes into the MATRIX string
for the currently logged-in user, and indicates what their permission
settings are. </p>

<p>Some of these definitions are unique in nature while the rest 
are generalized to apply to many different objects such as 
tables or files, indicated by a string <b>xxx</b> in the following. </p>

<p>The unique settings are identified in the USYM table, field KEYNAME with a short
string of two or three letters, and have special meaning within
WinPCS. They are used to allow and disallow large parts of the menu
tree and some powerful and dangerous tools that can be made available 
there for the users that need them, and removed for the users who do
not need them.  </p>

<h4>SLK </h4>
<p> Show Links in hierarchies (hier/ftree.c) A or R means show the links,
	H means do not show the links. </p>

<h4>Exxx </h4>
<p> Edit data in table xxx (nconn/cdisp1.c)
	Default is H; set to A to enable. R makes for a Read-only	
	Entry screen, a not very useful construct.</p>

<p>A special case of these E series settings is:</p>

<h4>EAUTOCODE </h4>
<p> Control the saving of records (report formats) in the 
	AUTOCODE table.  This follows the general pattern but is, 
	like AUTOCODE itself, hardcoded. (vrep/pdes1.c)</p>
<p>Note that if there is no EAUTOCODE defined in USYM the default
will be H (as for all the E series entries) and no-one can save 
report-formats; it will appear that the AUTOCODE table is 
somehow broken, while it is just being marked as off-limits.  </p>

<h4>Vxxx </h4>
<p> View data in table xxx 
	(nconn/cdisp1.c nconn/wild.c vconn/vconnwp.c vconn/special.c)
	Default is H; set to R or A to enable.  Although Views
	are basically read-only, the A setting allows additional,
	possibly modifying, actions 
	(<a href="call3206.html#Cat6132"> LCXCALLA pushbuttons </a>), and also
	allows associated VCONN lists to allow changing connections
	instead of just looking at them.</p>

<h4>Sxxx </h4>
<p> Set status on data in table xxx 
	(nconn/inspect.c rconn-lx/make_isam.c)
	Default is A; set this to R or H to disable or hide status-settings</p>

<h4>Cxxx </h4>
<p> Make connections affection connection-table ("conbase") xxx/ 
	nconn/make.c rconn-lx/make_isam.c
	Default is A; set to R or H to disable changing connections.</p>

<h4>Dxxx </h4>
<p> Disconnect control ? </p>

<h4>Lxxx </h4>
<p> control menu-entries for running various functions in LCX files.
	Default there is H. LCX-functions called elsewhere in the system, 
	are available to everyone, and any permission-controls are via
<a href="lcxh.html#pcs_permission">pcs_permission( )</a> 
function-calls. </p>

<h4>GC </h4>
<p> Gang Connections (vconn/vconnwp.c vconn/special.c, vrep/vrepwp.c)
	Set to A to enable running Gang Connections from reports.
	Set to H or R to disable running Gang Connections.</p>

<h4>TO </h4>
<p> Controls System/Toolbox
	When set to H, these menu entries are disabled. When set to
	A or R, these menu entries are enabled.</p>

	<p>This setting also affects 
	the presence or absence of the menu-entries System/Server 
	and System/Run depending on a setting in winpcs.ini:</p>

	<p>Controls System/Server menu entry, which appears only if 
	winpcs.ini [MENU] SERVER=PRESENT and TO has A</p>

	<p>Controls System/Run menu entry along with the UE and SR settings,
	and values in WinPCS.INI section [MENU]:</p>

	<p>RUNMENU=PRESENT, TO is A and UE is A </p>
	<p>RUNMENU=SRCONTROLD, SR is not H</p>

<h4>UE </h4>
<p> Controls the System/Define Users. This is grayed-out when the
	UE is set to H, and available otherwise.  </p>

	<p>This setting also affects the 
	presence or absence of the System/Run menu entry depending on
	a setting in winpcs.ini and the TO setting, as detailed above.</p>

<h4>RM </h4>
<p> Controls the System/Run Macro menu entry. 
	This is grayed-out when RM is set to H, and available otherwise.</p>

<h4>SI </h4>
<p> Controls the System/Standard Import menu entry. 
	This is grayed-out when SI is set to H, and available otherwise.
	This menu entry is only present when winpcs.ini section [MENU]
	entry STDIMP=PRESENT. </p>

<h4>SR </h4>
<p> Controls System/Standard Reports.
	This menu entry is only present when winpcs.ini section [MENU]
	entry STDREP=PRESENT. 
	If so, the menu entry is grayed-out when SI is set to H, 
	and available otherwise.</p>

	<p>If winpcs.ini section [MENU] entry RUNMENU=SRCONTROLD,
	this setting controls the System/Run submenu tree, when set
	to H this submenu tree is grayed out.</p>

<h4>ED </h4>
<p> Controls the entire sub-menu tree System/Edit INI files.
	H means it is not available, R or A means it will be available.
	(winpcs31/rconfig.c)</p>

<h4>TR </h4>
<p> Controls the System/Trans menu entry
	This is grayed-out when TR is set to H, and available otherwise.</p>

<h4>IN </h4>
<p> Controls the System/Inspect menu entry
	This is grayed-out when IN is set to H, and available otherwise.</p>

<h4>SF </h4>
<p> Controls the System/Synfare menu entry; set H to disable, A and R to enable.
	This is grayed-out when SF is set to H, and available otherwise.</p>

<h4>SW </h4>
<p> Controls the System/Web menu tree. This is present when
	winpcs.ini section [MENU] entry SYSTEM_WEB=PRESENT,
	and the SW setting is A or R.  If the setting is H this menu tree
	will be completely absent, not even grayed-out.</p>

<!-- 

Suggested simplifications:
	TO to only control the Toolbox, following pattern of IN TR or SF
	UE to only control the Define Users, following pattern of IN 
	SR to only control the System/Run tree, same as how SW controls System/Web

	ESTDREP settings to control the System/Standard Reports:  
		H is invisible/disabled, R means run reports but no changes
		A means do everything you want.
	
	New entry SS to control System/Server
	New entry SH to control System/Hierarchies

	None of the Lxxx

<h1>Quick Report Print List Functions -- Category 17</h1>

<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>The purpose of this function is to be able to run printing jobs from the Report. As the
Quick Reports have internal state information that makes it remember where data in the fields
came from, this is exploited.

<h3>Enabling control in WinPCS:</h3>

<p>The action is defined as a standard feature of the Quick Reports. These have 
an additional pushbutton which invokes this function from the Report View.  The function will
be called several times when this button is clicked.</p>

<p>The icon name on the pushbutton is PRLIST, and this should be defined in REFBMP31.INI
just like all other pushbuttons. If this is not defined there, the button will appear 
grayed with the "Default" text on it.</p>

<p>The name of the function is to be defined in WinPCS.INI, section [REPORTS] entry PRLIST_FUNCTION=
If this is not present, it defaults to "noop".</p>

<h3>Disallowed functions:</h3>
<p>DDE callback and document-drawing functions are only available inside the DDE 
callback and Printing callback environments.  There is however no restrictions on 
initiating printing or DDE-operations. This is actually one of the major uses of these
functions: to cause printing of all check-sheets or punchitems in a report.</p>

<h3>LCX files</h3>
<p>All functions referred to here one of the files referred to via PRVIEW= in the [LCX] section in 
<a href="clientini.html"> client.ini</a>.</p>

<h3>Callback functions:</h3>
<p>The function is called repeatedly as:
<pre>
<em>function</em><b>(</b><em>report</em><b>,</b>  <em>row</em><b>,</b>  <em>turn</em><b>,</b> <em>itemcol</em><b>,</b>
<em>itembase</em><b>,</b>  <em>itemfield</em><b>,</b>  <em>item</em><b>,</b> <em>relcol</em><b>,</b>
<em>relbase</em><b>,</b>  <em>relfield</em><b>,</b>  <em>rel</em><b>);</b>
</pre>
</p>

<p>It is called the first time with the value <b>BEGIN</b> for the <em>row</em>. During this
call it may set up common state information in global variables that can be used later. It may
also return a Cancel value to stop further processing. </p>

<p>Each subsequent call then corresponds to a row in the report where both the selected
columns have some useful, non-blank, values in it. For these calls, the <em>row</em>
will refer to the conventional negative row numbers expected by functions such as
RepGet


<p>The argument <em>report</em> is a reference to the report-data


 (the "vpx" that accesses
the data within the report-view) "row" is the row from the report that the
current call is made on, suitable for use with functions such as 
<a href="lcxh.html#RepGet">RepGet( )</a>, if that should be
interesting; the "turn" is a sequence number of the call, it starts at <b>-1</b>
and steps upwards.

The "item-" arguments are the column index, table, main field, and
tag-number of the first selected column, the "rel-" arguments are for the
second selected column.

The function is called once before the printing run starts, with the
string "BEGIN" instead of a row index, and once after the set of records
printed ends, with the string "END" instead of the row index. Other values
of the row index indicate actual data to be printed. The purpose of these
Begin and End calls is to be able to start off with some question or
dialog, and if necessary, close Word or similar clean-up afterwards.

The function should return a numerical value to indicate if it is to
continue,
and it may return an optional string to be displayed in the odometer
window as a second element of the set.

The numerical value is 0 to continue normally with the next printing run;
it should be -1 to stop prematurely, but make a call for "END". This is
typical mid-run Cancel action.  And the function can return -2 to stop
right away, without doing the end cleanup-call. This latter is probably
most useful for handling the case of an initial question being "no, don't
want to do anything".


WinPCS.INI, section [REPORTS], optional
----------
PRLIST_INFO=Print items from the report.
----------
If the default information on the PRLIST button ("Print Checklist,
certificate, or other form") isn't suitable, another information text can
be placed here.

The looping will display an odometer window, and this provides the
familiar "cancel" possibility: Closing the odometer makes it finish the
current print run, then perform the "END" call to close Word or suchlike,
much like returning -1 from the printing function would have done.






<h3>Return Value:</h3>


<h3>Execution context:</h3>
<p>The execution context is created before the first call (BEGIN) in the sequence and 
lasts until after the last call (END). Global variable values set in any early calls
will remain available in later calls.</p>

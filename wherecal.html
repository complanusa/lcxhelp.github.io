<h1>WinPCS Macro Calls Invocations and Origins</h1>
<p>File Date: 2013-05-24.</p>

<p>The following describes all places in WinPCS where macro 
functions are called. 
Which function and how the call is enabled is detailed in the following. 
The interested reader should turn to the appropriate section in the System 
Manual or this Macro Help File for a complete description of any utility or 
function mentioned in the following; the descriptions here only concern 
what is needed to explain the macro LCX calls, whether purpose, bugs, 
or availability.</p>

<p> The numbers of the categories correspond to the internal identity of 
the category in the 16-bit systems.   The purpose of this was to control
availability of functions in various contexts, but this is done by having
secondary lists of callback functions in the 32-bit systems, enabled when
relevant only.  However, the division is still rather useful, as it makes
easier to update this document as changes are made to the WinPCS source 
code.</p>

<p> Any differences between 16 and 32-bit systems will be noted in the sections
where they occur. Some of these are server-side functions where there are
a limited set of options and functionality available.  Other limitations are
simply that some functions are unavailable or meaningless in certain 
contexts. Functions not listed as inadvisable or unavailable can be expected
to work as documented.</p>

<p>The entries titled  "Enabling control in WinPCS" give a short 
description of how the function call comes into being. It is obvious 
that this requires the referenced function and file to actually exist. 
On server-side callbacks, all called functions are expected to be in the
set of files listed in the server.ini.</p>

<p>Unless otherwise noted, failure in this respect is quiet; references 
to unknown function or unknown files are not reported, and in general 
results in a no-operation. In several cases, when a macro function is 
not deemed necessary, default operations are available to be put in 
their place. Again, this will be noted as necessary.</p>

<p>The "execution context" refers to the data structure that is created 
when the macro files are first read.  It contains the code to be 
executed, any predefined global variables, and any global variables 
defined by the macro function when they run.  Several independent 
execution contexts may exist at any time, and there may also be several  
macro function runs during the lifetime of any one execution environment.  
In this case, all global variables set up by the macro code in an early 
call are accessible during later calls.   This is referred to as a 
re-entered execution context.</p>

<p> When macro functions themselves refer to other LCX files and functions, 
indirectly or directly, additional execution contexts, independent of 
the first one, may be created.  Global variables in one execution context 
do not exist in any other execution context, not even when the two 
contexts exist simultaneously.  This happens as a matter of routine 
with Print formatting functions, notably 
<a href="lcxh.html#unicert">unicert( )</a>
and the older (and deprecated 16-bit systems only) DDE callback functions
invoked via a call to <a href="lcxh.html#rundde">rundde( )</a>; 
and also indirect trough making and breaking connections, 
<a href="lcxh.html#connect">connect( )</a>, 
<a href="lcxh.html#disconnect">disconnect( )</a>,
or <a href="lcxh.html#disconnectall">disconnectall( )</a> 
calls.  The "callback function" entry shows how 
the definition of the function should look. The names of the function and 
its arguments is of course not critical, the names chosen as an example 
are meant to be descriptive.  What is important is the number of 
arguments. The functions may be defined  with fewer arguments, but if they 
are defined with more arguments than shown, error messages will appear. 
In many cases, the return value from the calling function is also 
of importance, and this will be noted wherever it applies.</p>

<h1>WEBIO</h1>

<p>The WinPCS server can understand certain html requests, amongst
these are GET on some urls. Most of these map to files in the 
directory identified via the 
<a href="serverini.html#options.wwwroot">wwwroot= entry in server.ini</a>
but there are a number of special urls that have predefined meaning.</p>

<p>These are the following: 
<a href="#wwwroot">/</a>, 
<a href="#wwwinfo">/info</a>, 
<a href="#wwwspeed">/speed</a>, 
<a href="#wwwwebapi">/webapi/*</a>. Each of these are described below.</p>

<p>Urls that map to web pages in files in subdirectories under the 
<a href="serverini.html#options.wwwroot">wwwroot</a>
may be made subject to authentication as well,
this is controlled via the
<a href="serverini.html#options.htrestrict">htrestrict</a>
and 
<a href="serverini.html#options.htrealm">htrealm</a>
entries in server.ini</p>


<a name="wwwroot"></a> 
<h3>Special URL /</h3>
<p>This returns the contents of a file named index.* from the 
<a href="serverini.html#options.wwwroot">wwwroot</a>
directory. If there are more than one file named index.* here,
the prioritized order is: <tt>index.html</tt>, 
or if this is not present, <tt>index.htm</tt>
or if this is not present either, any other file named 
index with any other extension, first in the alphabet. </p>

<p>If there is no index.* file there at all, this becomes equivalent
to the <a href="#wwwinfo">/info</a> special url. </p>

<a name="wwwinfo"></a> 
<h3>Special URL /info</h3>
<p>This returns a standard page with information about the server, 
and which project it runs and the client that came in asking.</p>

<a name="wwwspeed"></a> 
<h3>Special URL /speed</h3>
<p>This returns a page similar to
<a href="#wwwinfo">/info</a> but also shows the 
round-trip time on the network. It is similar to the speed-measurement
tool in the standard WinPCS client.</p>

<a name="wwwwebapi"></a>
<h2>URLs under /webapi</h2>

<p>The webapi functions are for the benefit of the application
server, that can ask the WinPCS server for various data items
and perform various activities.</p>

<p>All the /webapi urls require the user to be 
authenticated, using basic auth or bearer auth, 
so that the WinPCS server can know who is the
effective user, which will be determining the rights
and capabilities. </p>

<p>The webapi urls are:<br/>
<a href="#wwwwebapi_authenticate">/webapi/authenticate</a><br/>
<a href="#emailUserExists">/webapi/emailUserExists</a><br/>
<a href="#wwwwebapi_sqlexec">/webapi/sqlexec</a><br/>
<!-- <a href="#fillTreeRoots">fillTreeRoots</a><br/>  -->

<h3>/webapi/authenticate</h3>
<h4>Request format Example:</h4>
<pre>
GET /webapi/authenticate
Authorization: <em>(Basic or Bearer)</em>
Content-Length: 1

</pre>

<h4>Description:</h4>

<p>As all the /webapi urls require the user to be 
authenticated, using basic auth or bearer auth, this url just 
verifies that the user-authentication is valid. It is otherwise
a no-op.</p>

<!-- 0        1         2         3         4 -->

<h3>/webapi/emailUserExists</h3>
<h4>Request format Example:</h4>
<pre>
GET /webapi/emailUserExists
Authorization: <em>(Basic or Bearer)</em>
Content-Length: <em>length</em>

{"email":"whoever@example.com"}
</pre>

<h4>Description:</h4>

<p>Given a user's email, the existence or otherwise of this in the 
WUSER table on the server is verified, and if there is someone with
that email address defined there, that user's entire record from WUSER
is returned, in JSON format similar to what is shown in the example below. 
This contains the name, the encoded passwords and so on 
as per the current layout of WUSER. </p>


<hr/>
<a name="wwwwebapi_sqlexec"></a>
<h3>/webapi/sqlexec</h3>
<h4>Request format Example:</h4>
<pre>
GET /webapi/sqlexec
Authorization: <em>(Basic or Bearer)</em>
Content-Length: <em>length</em>

{"query":"SELECT itr,description FROM REFITR1"}
</pre>

<h4>Description:</h4>

<p>This allows the server to take a query as part of the body of the 
incoming request and process this. The header should contain the 
authentication string and the length of the contents which is the query,
as exemplified by:</p>

<p>The server will return the results of this query as a JSON array, 
something similar to this:</p>

<pre>
{[{"F00":"Q02A","F01":"Pipe Insulation "},
{"F00":"E02A","F01":"Electrical Motors (LV/HV)"},
{"F00":"E36A","F01":"MV Cable Test Record"}]}
</pre>

<p>There will be more varieties of these /webapi 
functions in the future.</p>

<h1>URLs referring to LCX files</h1> 
<p>If an URL refers to an LCX file, the file is expected to contain
code that is to be run, and there will have to be a reference to 
a function in the file and some operational parameters to be 
passed to the code. </p>

<p>The function will run server-side, so it can use all of 
the defined functions that are available on the server. </p>

<p>The function itself will be called as per: </p>

<pre>
lcxfunction(projectnumber)
</pre>

<p>and the passed-in parameters from the URL string will appear as global 
variables available to the function. </p>

<p>The following examples show the URLs and how they get handled:</p> 

<pre>
http://server/abcd.lcx
</pre>

<p>This calls a function in <tt>abcd.lcx</tt> named <tt>main()</tt>
as <tt><b>main(</b><em>projectnumber</em><b>)</b></tt> </p>

<pre>
http://server/abcd.lcx?f=something
</pre>

<p>This calls a function in <tt>abcd.lcx</tt> named <tt>something()</tt> 
as <tt><b>something(</b><em>projectnumber</em><b>)</b></tt> </p>

<pre>
http://server/abcd.lcx?f=something&foo=xyz&bar=abcd
</pre>

<p>As above, this calls the function in <tt>abcd.lcx</tt> named <tt>something()</tt> 
as <tt><b>something(</b><em>projectnumber</em><b>)</b></tt>.
Global variables named <tt><b>foo</b></tt> and <tt><b>bar</b></tt> with the values shown will be defined
and can be read by the function.  </p>

<p>The page shown is basically whatever html string that 
is returned by the function.  One common approach is to have the
function write text into a file with html in it, then 
we want to return the contents of this file, using the meta-function 
<b>$filecontents(<em>path</em>)</b>, with a return-value syntax looking like: </p>

<pre>
	string path, filename;

	filename = "something.html";

	// code for creating and writing the contents to the file would go here 

	path = ExpandPath("9:\htdocs\Items\", filename); 

	return(concat("$filecontents(", path, ")")); 
</pre>

<p>The returned string coming from this LCX function would look like:</p>
<pre>
	$filecontents(C:\winpcs\project\htdocs\Items\something.html)
</pre>
<p>and the server then knows that what the client wanted was the contents of this file, not merely its name.</p>

<p>Note that since the initial http request is for the LCX file, then any relative paths in <tt>href=</tt> and 
similar entries in the html file will refer to the directory where this LCX file is located, and not necessarily
where the file itself gets written, should this be somewhere else. For maximal compatibility, these locations
should be the same; in other words, the file should be written in the same directory as the LCX file is located. </p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>The following can be an URL, whether direct like this or called via
some javascript or otherwise, as shown in these examples:</p>

<pre>
&lt;a href="wmoreinfo.lcx?f=ShowInfo&grandrepref=REPITR4&level=CERTAC1&rootthis=150"&gt;View subsystem 150&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;a href="http://example.com:5166/wmoreinfo.lcx?f=ShowInfo&grandrepref=REPITR4&level=CERTAC1&rootthis=150"&gt;View subsystem 150&lt;/a&gt;

http://example.com:5166/wmoreinfo.lcx?f=ShowInfo&grandrepref=REPITR4&level=CERTAC1&rootthis=150
</pre>

<p>The handling LCX function for this is as follows. It refers to another
function, <tt>TableRunKern()</tt> which writes a page of information to a file,
and returns the name of the file. The return value of this function tells the
system to put back the contents of that file.</p>

<pre>
string level;
string grandrepref;
string rootthis;

ShowInfo()
{
    string outfile, htext;
    string path;

    outfile = TableRunKern(grandrepref, level, rootthis);

	/* wmoreinfo.lcx is in htdocs, and the outfile is a simple filename referring to a file also in htdocs. */

    path = ExpandPath(concat("9:\htdocs\", outfile));

    /* Return value from this function will be the contents of this file! */

    /* Tell the server to put out the contents of the file, instead of a string.  */
    return(concat("$filecontents(", path, ")"));
}
</pre>



<h1>Calls via xmlHttp</h1>
<p>See the example under
<a href="lcxh.html#RepToJSON">RepToJSON( )</a> 
where there is a function ListItems() in a file tablelist.lcx, which
is then called from the following chunk of javascript:</p>

<pre>
    var xmlHttp = null;

    xmlHttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
    xmlHttp.open("GET", "tablelist.lcx?f=ListItems&amp;Table=CERTSITE", false);
    xmlHttp.send(null);

    var jsonstuff = xmlHttp.responseText;

</pre>
<p>The returned JSON code that the LCX function returned is then processed further. </p>

<p>This is another chunk of Javascript showing how strings from the javascript code
in the web page can be sent to a server-side debugger-output channel. </p>

<pre>

/* Emit some tracing message on the WinPCS server debug channel. */
function DebugOut(Here, Text)
{
    var DbgHttp = null;
    var theurl = null;
    var encodedtext;

    encodedtext = encodeURIComponent(Text);

    theurl = 'khier.lcx?f=DebugEmit&amp;Here='+Here+'&amp;Text='+encodedtext;

    DbgHttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
    DbgHttp.open("GET", theurl, false);
    DbgHttp.send(null);
}

</pre>

<p>The relevant function in the referenced khier.lcx file is as follows.
Global variables Text and Here reflect the strings passed after the 
&amp;Here= and &amp;Text= in the inbound URL. The text has been encoded to
remove problems with http special characters, and the LCX function
<a href="lcxh.html#URLDecode">URLDecode( )</a> 
changes this back to plain text for subsequent output.
</p>

<pre>

/* Emit stuff on the debugger called from the browser html code */

string Text;
string Here;

DebugEmit()
{
    trace(Here, URLDecode(Text));
    return("");
}

</pre>

<h1>In-line LCX functions</h1>

<p>It is possible to embed LCX functions inside the html on a webpage. 
The syntax is:</p>

<pre>
&lt;?lcx 
anyname(string projno) 
{ 
	/* any reasonably useful LCX code */
	return("This &lt;b&gt;chunk of html&lt;/b&gt; will appear."); 
}
?&gt;
</pre>

<p>What will happen is that when this code section is found, the function
will be run, and the code-section <?lcx ... ?> will be replaced with the
output from the function. </p>

<p>This function has a placeholder name, and can call any of the server-side system-defined
functions as well as any of the functions present in the set of LCX files loaded
on the server. </p>

<!-- Proposed additionals: 
echo(items...) puts out the concatenation of the items onto the data to go onto the page 
at that point. As opposed to gathering all and returning it at the end in the code, instead we
gather the lot during the function call and emit them out at the end as if it were the 
return value.

Session globals, so variables that are set in one function can appear in another function,
but not like the server-globals that will appear the same for all users. 
Maybe best done via the client's cookies or some such state-info there. 

See (rfc2109), (rfc2965), rfc6265

Part of the reply to the client, to set a cookie. The cookie has a name and a value, that can
be whatever we like (within reasonable limits). 

Set-Cookie: name=value [; expires=date] [; domain=domain] [; path=path] [; secure]

Session cookie has no expiration, it goes away when the browser closes. 
Set-Cookie: name=value 

Expiration dates are in the printable unix date format and NOT the rfc3339 or iso8601, unfortunately: 
	wkd, dd Mmm yyyy hh:mm:ss GMT

[; expires=date] [; domain=domain] [; path=path] [; secure]

Client will come back with the string 
Cookie: name=value 
in the header. Presumably the rest of the info is there as well.

Cookies state can be stored server-side such as name being client-session identifier 
and they expire there a certain time after last use or when being actively deallocated.

Cookies management, cookies being state info sitting in the client's browser.
The server-side code here is basically stateless. 

setcookie(stateinfo);
stateinfo = readcookie();  ?

Alternates:
	JSON Web Tokens, JWTs 

<p>TBD: add echo() for finer-grain output into the page.  </p>

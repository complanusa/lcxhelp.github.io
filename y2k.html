<h1>WinPCS and year 2000</h1>

<p>This is an update of a document originally published in connection with the Year 2000 transition
and how WinPCS would handle this. It does also give some more background info on how WinPCS
deals with dates in general, as this may not be obvious. </p>

<h2>How WinPCS handles dates internally.</h2>

<p>WinPCS stores dates as 4 bytes in the tables. Two bytes treated as
a 15-bit integer are used for the full year, for a range from 1-32767; 
one byte is used for the month number 1-12
and one more for the day number 1-31. Year numbers from 32768 onwards are
equivalents to negatively numbered years, before Christ.  </p>

<p>Year number 0 is not used. The value N/A is encoded as January 14, 0,
and may only be entered by typing or importing the string N/A.</p>

<p>Other Year 0 dates show as blank. No other year, day, or month 
number is given any special significance, except that as Year 0
does not exist, null dates show in the year 65535, which is 
interpreted as year 1 BC. Any end-of-file conditions and the like
are reported by the operating system, or Btrieve/Pervasive, and do 
not depend on any particular data values found.</p>

<p>On input, if the date conversion function sees a blank
string for the year, the date field is set to blank.
If the year input is one or two digits, 0-9, 00-99, the year
is expected to fall between 1990 and 2089. If the year input is
three digits or more, even with leading zeros, the year is taken
at face value. Year 000 translates into year 65535 (really year -1,
or 1 BC) in these cases.</p>

<p>If any number less than 100 for the year, including zero, 
that is, from 0 to 99 inclusive; is found, the resulting year is
placed in the range 1990-2089. Any year numbers greater than 100
are taken as that year. The choice of the range 1990-2089 was made
based on the scope of use of WinPCS by our customers.</p>

<p>To summarize:

<tr valign="top" > <td>Input year</td>      <td>Taken as, and stored as:</td></tr>
<tr valign="top" > <td>N/A</td>             <td>No date (converts to January 14 Year 0)</td></tr>

<p>The full year is always provided on output, no abbreviations are done, 
even when the settings in WinPCS' server.ini for the 32-bit systems, or within
the Windows Operating System for 16-bit systems prescribes
2-digit year numbers.</p>

<p>Users must beware of mis-typing years, for example, typing in "998" will
result in the year 998, not 1998.</p>

<h2>Date Formatting</h2>
<p>On the old 16-bit WinPCS systems, dates were formatted as per the settings on the client machine
running WinPCS. On the 32-bit WinPCS systems, the dates are formatted as per a setting in SERVER.INI,
which can be different than the default for various users on that server or on the client machines.</p>

<p>It has become apparent that different logged-in users on a Windows machine can have different date
formatting settings, and this is not all that easy to control. There is also the problem of widely geographically
separated clients having local settings that differ on which formatting to use. 
By enforcing a uniform setting within the project, this becomes simplified. 
At the moment (May 2005),  3 distinct ways of ordering year, month, and day are 
being used on various projects around the world. </p>

<p>On input, strings beginning with one of <b>Jan Feb Mar Apr May Mai Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Okt Nov Dec Des</b> may 
be used in the position of the month, and these will be converted to the conventional month numbers by WinPCS.

<h2>How WinPCS calculates shifts of days and weeks</h2>

<p>Day calculations are done using Julian Day numbers, which currently, and
for the foreseeable future have values in the vicinity of 2.4 million,
for example, </p>

	<p>
	11 August 1998 is Julian Day number 2451037<br/>
	1 January 2000 is Julian Day number 2451545<br/>
	29 February 2000 is Julian Day number 2451604<br/>
	31 December 2099 is Julian Day number 2488069<br/></p>

<p>The date conversion functions from date to J.Day number and the reverse
base themselves on the Gregorian Calendar for all dates later than 
15 October 1582; in which years divisible by 4, unless they are 
century years not divisible by 400, are leap years. </p>

<p>This particular day-numbering scheme was invented in 1583 by Joseph 
Justus Scaliger, and is used today directly by astronomers.  The 
conversion algorithms used in WinPCS have `astronomical scope` in 
the sense that they work properly over thousands of years. For WinPCS'
purposes, this enormous range is not really needed, but this system of
linear day numbers results in a lot of simplification and absence of edge 
and corner cases that require special treatment.  It also puts 
to rest any concerns about any special dates thay could otherwise cause 
systems to malfunction. Using the linear day-numbering also simplifies all sorts
of day and period calculations. </p>

<p>Although the standard Julian Day number changes at noon, there is still a one-to-one
correspondence with the calendar date. In the Help/About/Res dialog box, the 
Julian Day number shown there is the one beginning at noon today, which will
be off by one compared to some other references, between midnight and noon. Strictly
speaking, WinPCS uses what is called the chronological Julian Day, which,
like common date stamps, begins at midnight, 12 hours before the reference noon. </p> 

<p>No expectations need to be made about the numbers of days between any two dates,
whenever this is of interest, the system calculates the Julian Day numbers
of the two dates in question and finds the difference between them.</p>

<p>WinPCS also uses a system of week numbers, which are six-digit strings
with the first four being the year, and the last two are the number of
that week in the year. The Julian Day numbering lies behind this as well,
since the Julian day numbers are divisble by 7 once a week, on Mondays.</p>

<p>Each week in WinPCS is reckoned from Monday to Sunday.  Functions
exist to properly add and subtract these. These function calculates the
Julian Day number of the Monday in the weeks of interest and uses
them to find offsets or differences.</p>

<p>With hindsight, it might have been preferable to put the Julian day
numbers into the databases as well, and store them there as plain 
32-bit integers. SQL systems, to which there are plans to move WinPCS,  
do not have any standard way of handling blank and N/A date values, 
so some customizations are going to be done here.
For reasons of interoperability, the native date formats ought to be 
used to the extent possible.  </p>

<p>One issue that is necessary to be aware of: WinPCS formats the date as
specified in server.ini or (for 16-bit systems) by Windows, and 
this could be different between systems. Text data in reports 
containing dates do not necessarily sort properly unless in the order 
year-month-day. This ordering can be produced on any WinPCS system through
the DateCanonical() function, and is generally recommended, but many
projects still want to use day-month-year or month-day-year. </p>

<p>Finally, the system that WinPCS runs on, must provide WinPCS with the
proper date so that WinPCS activities have correct input. But
given correct input, there is no design decisions causing shortcomings 
in WinPCS that should preclude it from handling dates properly in 
the future. </p>

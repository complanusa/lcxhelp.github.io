<h1>WinPCS Server Command-Line (Windows)</h1>

<p>File Date: 2015-05-13</p>

<p>The WinPCS server program, w31tcp.exe, can be started as a standalone command on
the command-line, from a shortcut, or installed and started as a service.</p>

<p>During testing of a new installation, running it in the command-line will help
with diagnosing any problems that may be with the WinPCS or database server, such as
permission errors, files or tables that are not found for whatever reason, errors in
LCX files, and other startup items that should be and remain OK for the life of the project.</p>

<p>When run as a shortcut or from the command line, it will run with the capabilities and
rights of whatever the user that started it has. When run as a service, the default
is to run as Local System, but this may not be desireable. LocalSystem has too many 
unnecessary permissions and rights within the local machine, that is, the server, and it
has too few if any at all, for accessing data on other servers that it may be connected to.
The relevant macro-function that can be used for moving data to the server is
<a href="lcxh.html#FilePut">FilePut( )</a> 
and it requires that the WinPCS Server has write access to wherever it is indicated that it is
to put data files.
</p>

<p>It is therefore recommended to create a standard, limited-rights user,  or use an existing
one with the correct limited permissions, 
and let the WinPCS server run as this user.  The benefits are that there is more control
over where the WinPCS server may write transferred files to, and it can easily be
prevented from writing or reading, and thus make accessible, any files beyond its own.</p>

<p>Generally, a separate file-server for documents may be useful, and the WinPCS server 
should be able to access this; this is not possible or desirable with the Local System account.</p>

<p>Starting the WinPCS server on the command-line or as a shortcut is similar to the invocations for
the client: the working directory should be the SERVER directory, and the executable
W31tcp.EXE can be located in a separate PROG_SERVER directory or similar.  No command-line
parameters per se are used in these cases. </p>

<p>Starting the WinPCS server as a service requires all the server-side DLL files, including
ANCHORS.DLL to be located in the project's SERVER directory, and that the service is installed from a command-line. 
Once installed, it can be started and stopped from the Control Panel/Administrative Tools/Services applet
of the Windows system, and the effective user can also be changed there if necessary.  Note that
"command-line" means Cmd.EXE, it does <b>not</b> mean Start/Run, since the latter window vanishes as soon
as the command is performed, causing the information about how it went to be lost.  Completely useless...</p>

<p>The command-line parameters are strings separated with spaces. The first parameter should begin with 
a - (minus or hyphen). -? and -help makes it produce the information about its command-line parameters. </p>

<p>The basic commands are: <br>
-install<br>
-start<br>
-instart<br>
-remove<br>
</p>

<p>Instart simply is -install followed by -start.  -install may be optionally followed by the username and password
of the user as which the WinPCS server is to run, or these can be changed in the Services control panel later on. 
The default will be LocalSystem, which as noted, might not be the best choice, since it has access to everything 
in the local machine and nothing elsewhere. </p>

<p>The -install and -instart commands take an optional username and password when the service is to be run
as other than Local System. Alternate service-names can be specified as the original service name with a suffix,
in order to run several services on the same project on the same server, for report-generator purposes.
This suffix must be specified for -install, -instart, -start, and -remove in order to correctly identify the service.
</p>

<p>The following commands with options are defined: </p>
<table><tbody>
<tr><td>-install</td><td>Installs the service, set to be running as Local System</td></tr>
<tr><td>-start</td><td>Starts the service</td></tr>
<tr><td>-instart</td><td>Installs, then starts the service in one go</td></tr>
<tr><td>-remove</td><td>Removes the service</td></tr>

<tr><td>-install accountname password</td><td>Installs the service with standard name with specified account-name or username, and password.</td></tr>
<tr><td>-instart accountname password</td><td>Installs the service with standard name with specified account-name or username, and password, then starts it.</td></tr>

<tr><td>-install -S suffix</td><td>Installs the service with name with the suffix added, as Local System</td></tr>
<tr><td>-instart -S suffix</td><td>Installs the service with name with the suffix added, as Local System, then starts it</td></tr>
<tr><td>-start -S suffix</td><td>Installs the service with name with the suffix added, as Local System</td></tr>

<tr><td>-instart accountname password -S suffix</td><td>Installs the service with standard name with specified account-name or username, and password</td></tr>

<tr><td>-a inifile</td><td>Command-line mode: use an alternate server.ini file. Used for tablet invocations mostly.</td></tr>

<h1>Date and time functions overview. </h1>

<p>The concept of time is central to many of WinPCS' subcomponents.
Whenever some structure is being constructed or planned, or there 
is some status-carrying object that is created or updated, 
there will always be some time stamps for when the action took place, 
along with who did this job, perhaps also why it was done, as is the
case for punchitems, as well as when it ought to be finished; that
could be input from the planning side. </p>

<h2>Time functions</h2>
<p>Time is handled by WinPCS in two forms: internally as the data going into and out of type T fields
in tables, and as text strings on the format HH:MM:SS.CC or a substring of this, using the conventional 
24-hour clock.  Notation with 12 hours and AM and PM are not implemented. Since clock-time values are 
mostly used within WinPCS and does not appear in reports, there is not much need for complicated 
formatting of time values.  This is in contrast to date values, which are of major importance.</p>

<p>Time spent by workers and recorded or planned are handled in units of manhours, and these are simple 
integers or fixed-point decimal numbers. </p>

<p>The LCX functions that handle clock time values are: </p>

<tr valign="top">

the omitted centiseconds or seconds will be 0, and puts the value into a field type T.<br/>  
Reading the value from this field later on will return the entire string in the form HH:MM.SS.CC</td>

<h2>Date functions</h2>
<p>Most activities in WinPCS have dates associated with them. These generally appear visibly in one of two forms, 
either as standard readable dates, with day, month, and year in some format or another, or it can be the 
week-number, conventionally specified as a 6-digit number, where the first 4 digits are the year, and the last 
two digits are the number of the week in that year, 1--53.  
In addition, there is the sequential Julian Day number system, which is useful for calculations.   In the LCX system, 
all of these are available, and there are functions to convert back and from each format.  The internal binary date
format underlying the field type D in the tables is not available on the outside; instead, all date values are converted
to and from the system defined standard date format.
More details and discussion of how WinPCS has no problems handling dates at the turn of the millennium is found
on the page <a href="y2k.html"> WinPCS and Year 2000</a>.</p>

<p>The ISO dates, week numbers, and Julian Day numbers sort naturally in the correct order. Julian Day numbers are also
most useful when calculating differences and offsets in days. The functions dealing with week-numbering all use 
the Julian Day number functions internally. </p>

<p>These are the four different ways of spelling out date values:</p>

<a href="lcxh.html#DateCanonical">DateCanonical( )</a>

with <a href="lcxh.html#substr">substr( )</a>. This is also used by the standalone system functions

All LCX functions expecting or returning date-values for conversion or storage use this format.

Julian Day number will be one greater than today's. This number is divisible by 7 on Mondays.
Most useful for calculating intervals of days. 
<a href="lcxh.html#julday">julday( )</a> converts a date to the Julian Day number, and 
<a href="lcxh.html#caldat">caldat( )</a> converts a Julian Day number to the date.
</td>

<tr valign="top">

where a useful unit of time for the periodicity is measured in weeks. The functions 
<a href="lcxh.html#WeekShift">WeekShift( )</a> and 
<a href="lcxh.html#WeekDelta ">WeekDelta ( )</a> 
can be used to calculate ranges of weeks.</td>

<p>The following functions deal with date values in all these formats, including conversions. 
The arguments and return values indicate the format-name as shown in the table above. Values shown
as <em>count</em> are integers, indicating number of days or weeks. </p>

<h2>Examples</h2>


<h3>Europian date format</h3>

<p>The following function uses
<a href="lcxh.html#DateCanonical">DateCanonical( )</a> and <a href="lcxh.html#substr">substr( )</a> 
to pick apart a date string, then re-assembles it in the DD/MM-YYYY format commonly used in Europe and Australia.</p>

<pre>
/* Convert system-formatted date (as per the dateformat= in server.ini)
    into the Europeian-style DD/MM-YYYY */
DateEuro(string symdate)
{
    string zdate, eudate;
    string y, m, d;
 
    zdate = DateCanonical(symdate);
    y = substr(zdate, 1, 4);
    m = substr(zdate, 6, 2);
    d = substr(zdate, 9, 2);
    eudate = concat(d, "/", m, "-", y);
    return(eudate);
}
</pre>

<h3>Comparing dates</h3>

<p>Direct comparison of system-formeat date strings is not always possible. 
Instead, the dates can be converted to Julian Day numbers, and these will compare reliably. </p>


<p>Week numbers may also be compared, but note that all seven days of any week will fold into the same week number. If the
desire is to determine if two dates are in the same week or not, this is however just what is needed. </p>

<h3>Days or weeks into the past or future</h3>

<p>To find a date in the future, convert to Julian Day number, and add the number of days ahead. 
For the past, subtract the number of days instead. Then convert the Julian Day number back to the date format. </p>

<p>For weeks, use the WeekShift() with a positive offset for the future and a negative offset for the past. </p>

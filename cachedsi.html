<h1>Cached SI report structures</h1>
<p>File Date: June 17 2005</p>

<p>WinPCS has a mechanism for caching the status-index reporting structures,
so the large SI reports will run faster.  The traditional SI goes depth-first
and has to visit a lot of possibly unnecessary records for its completion.</p>

<p>The motivation for this is that even the 32-bit server can be easily over-
loaded on a server when several large SI reports are run at the same time. 
The problem is the server having to be too busy, it is no longer the network
as was the problem on 16-bit systems -- running either 16 or 32-bit systems
locally shows this. </p>

<p>It was noted that all SI reports have a lot in common: they 
start off of some level higher than subsystem, and there is a varying 
number of levels of tags between this level and the check-sheets.  Two
common blocks of data were easy to identify: the system-hierarchy and the
equipment-hierarchy.  The connection tables between them is the same
CONCERT table as is being used in the regular subsystem-tag connections,
and the connection-table at the low end would be the usual status-carrying 
CONITR1, CONITR2 etc. or the non-carrying connection table for Punch Items
or similar. </p>

<p>The caching process thus establishes two tables containing cached information
through specially adapted SI reports, and stores them as SCAHIER for the system
hierarchies, and SCAEQP for the equipment hierarchy. The number of records in 
SCAHIER is low enough for this table to be cached in the client's memory. </p>

<p>When the report is to be run, it uses the standard report layout from
STAREP.INI (STATREES.INI on some projects) and populates this based on lookups
in the cached data sets.   This re-reading of a cache is a lot faster
than running the report ab initio every time, in particular when the project
is large and the data does not change much. Reconnections in the system or 
equipment hierarchies will not be reflected in reports until the next time
the cache is refreshed, but reconnections between subsystems and tags, 
as well as status on check-sheets and punchitems will be reflected 
immediately. </p>

<h2>SCAHIER layout</h2>
<p>The table SCAHIER has this layout: </p>
<pre>

SCAHIER         RSERIAL              0     0     4     R 0    M    0    A   
SCAHIER         CERTMILE             1     4     10    A 1    B    0    R   
SCAHIER         CERTSYS              2     14    10    A 2    B    0    R   
SCAHIER         CERTSITE             3     24    10    A 3    B    0    R   
SCAHIER         CERTHC1              4     34    10    A 4    B    0    R   
SCAHIER         CERTAC1              5     44    10    A 5    B    0    R   
SCAHIER         REFGROUP             6     54    10    A 6    B    0    R   
SCAHIER         REFAREA              7     64    10    A 7    B    0    R   
SCAHIER         CERTVEND             8     74    10    A 8    B    0    R   

</pre>

<p>Each of the fields hold the record number for the table inidicated by
the fieldname. These are blank or 0 when some table is not referenced. 
The lowest table in each hierarchy, normally CERTAC1, is referred to as the
"pivot" table.  The number of records in this table is about the same as
the number of these lowest-level objects, could be around 1000. (It is 899
on Kizomba B.)</p>

<p>This table is populated periodically as a cached copy of the system- 
and subsystem structure. Other hierarchies such as areas may be added, this
hasn't been done so far. </p>

<p>Here, the TABLEP/SERIALP identifies what is connected to the check-sheet, 
and the TABLE1/SERIAL1 identifies what is connected to the subsystem. The other
levels are for any intermediate connection-levels.  The fields TAGNOn are
mostly used for information, it simplifies the process of looking up the 
identities during the SI reports.  </p>

<p>This table is populated periodically as a cached copy of the equipment
structure.</p>

<h2>Periodic functions on the server.</h2>

<p>The WinPCS server has been given a mechanism for running a certain 
macrofunction at some specific daily time.  The idea is that the 
caching report, which takes about 20 minutes to complete, runs during 
the night when it does not bother anyone. To this end, the server 
may start this at some predetermined time.  </p>

<p>An alternative could have been to run some program controlled by
the Windows Task Sceduler, but this is not always available, and may 
require administrator access to the server, which is not necessarily
easy to obtain. </p>

<p>The relevant entries are in the SERVER.INI file.</p>

<p>Section <b>[options]</b> entry <b>periodic=on</b> turns the whole 
periodic activity on or off.  During tests, it may be turned off, 
during normal operations when everything is set up right, it
may be turned on.  Default, or when no <b>[periodic]</b> section is
defined,  is off. </p>

<p>Section <b>[periodic]</b> contains a number of entries describing the 
jobs to be done.  The entry <b>count=</b> indicates how many such jobs,
and each one of these is indexed as <b>1=</b>, <b>2=</b> etc. </p>

<p>The right hand side of the job entry inidicates the time and 
which macrofunction to be run at that time. 
For example, the periodic section shown here:</p>

<pre>
[periodic]
count=1
1=D (01:30) FormSICache
</pre>

<p>means that there is one job, and this is to run the function 
<b>FormSICache()</b> every night at 01:30. Further times for running the 
function may be listed as a space-separated list within the round 
brackets.  The D indicates Daily, for now, this is the only possibility.</p>

<p>Like all other macrocode on the server, this function is expected to be
in one of the files indicated for the server, which it loads at startup, 
section <b>[LCX]</b> entry <b>files=</b>. 

<h2>STATREES.INI and STAREP.INI</h2> 
<p>In order to populate the SCAHIER and SCAEQP tables, a set of
fairly standard and rigidly defined status index reports are run. Instead
of presenting the results in a report, they place them into these tables. </p>

<p>The macrofunction call to start these reports is the system-defined function
<a href="lcxh.html#CreateSICache">CreateSICache( )</a>  which takes two 
arguments. The first one is the name of the "pivot"-table, usually CERTAC1. 
The second argument is reserved for later changes, and can be anything.</p>

<p>Typically, this function is run once a day, or night, via the periodic 
mechaism detailed above.  For example, the function referred to in the 
earlier section on periodic activity is: </p>
<pre>
FormSICache()
{
	CreateSICache("CERTAC1", "unused"); 
	return(0);
}
</pre>

<p>The definition of the cached-sireports in STATREES.INI are 
SCACHE_H= for the system hierarchy, and SCACHE_L= for the equipment
hierarchy.  The SCACHE_H is an "upside-down" SI, where the pivot-table
(CERTAC1) is at the top, and the leaves are various higher-level objects
such as systems, sites, milestones and so forth. SCACHE_L is basically a
component index, listing everything that has or may have checksheets, 
punchitems, notes, commissioning-records or whatever else. The following 
excerpt from STATREES.INI shows the entries there relevant 
for these reports.</p>

</pre> 

<p>The system has strict expectations of the fields in these reports,
changing them may cause things to break in strange and undocumented ways!

<p>Caching of these tables may also be forced from the client, by
having some callback function there invoke the 
<a href="lcxh.html#CreateSICache">CreateSICache( )</a> 
function, like what is done on the server. 

<h3>How the reports are run</h3>
<p>When later there is a desire for running these cached reports, typically
on multiple systems or subsystems, they are run through the usual REFREP
mechanism. This has been set up so the flag-character which normally is M
for multiple-selection is replaced by an C to use the cached report-data,
and still a multiple selection. Single-selection reports are generally better
run as traditional SI reports, not cached ones.</p>

<p>The relevant function-call from in REFREP.LCX is 
<a href="lcxh.html#CachedSI">CachedSI( )</a> 
which takes the same arguments as the regular 
<a href="lcxh.html#statusindex">statusindex( )</a> 
function, but uses the cached data internally, as opposed to the 
regular variety that walks through the data. Once the report is 
run, it will be the same as any other.</p>

<h3>Field-functions</h3>
Since there are a number of data-sets cached on the client, some of
the field-functions are run on the client, not on the server. The 
regular SI reports ran all fields on the server, now there is a bit
of variation here as to which fields are filled in where.  This means that
some of these functions must be duplicated on the client.</p>

<p>All fields to do with the higher system-levels and the check-sheet table
are always done on the client-side. Fields to do with the status-carrying
table are done on the server. </p>

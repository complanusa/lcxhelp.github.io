<h1>Status Index Callbacks -- Category 9 (16-bit WinPCS)</h1> <p> 

<h3>Enabling control in WinPCS:</h3>
Function calls in this category are made when an operation function is defined in 
STATREES.INI for a field in a SI report.  The function is called once per record where the 
tree is complete, i.e. when a leaf record exists.  Calls are not made on records where 
the leaves are missing.

<h3>Disallowed functions:</h3>
You may not start another Status Index from within the first one.
DDE callback and document-drawing functions are only available inside the DDE 
callback and Printing callback environments.  

<h3>LCX files:</h3>
All LCX functions referred to in STATREES.INI SI sections are expected to be found in 
one of the files referred to via SI= in the [RCONN] section in WinPCS.ini

<h3>Callback function:</h3>
<pre><em>value_to_appear_in_field</em><b> = </b><em>function</em><b>(</b><em>value_found_in_field</em><b>, </b><em>treeline</em><b>, </b><em>rootitem</em><b>, </b><em>root_table</em><b>)</b></pre>

<p>The value_found_in_field is the inbound value. The treeline is a set containing all the 
tables in the tree-line being used at the moment. The last name is the leaf, the second to 
last name is the penultimate level, corresponding to #PENULT and #LEAF.  The 
rootitem is a two-part set on the form table+identity+ and the root_table is the table on 
the top of the status index, where this rootitem lives. All current records in these tables 
listed refer to the instances of all objects in the tree.
The value_found_in_field argument and the function's return value need not have any  
logical connection whatever.

<h3>Execution context:</h3>
Shared with <a href="call0012.html">
Category 12 -- View report before/after functions</a>.  Also Re-entered. The 
before function, then the Status callback functions, then the after function are called in 
this order in the same execution context. Fields may set up global variables in early 
fields and read them in later fields. Sometimes this is useful, for counting punch items
for example.

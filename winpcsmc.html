<h1>WinPCS Super-Server 1.6</h1>
<a name="Intro"> </a> 

<p>The WinPCS Super-server is designed to allow starting and stopping
of the main WinPCS server program and the Tablet-handling client, 
remotely, without having to have access to the main server machine. </p>

<p>Version 1.6 is designed to allow up to 4 different projects on the same
machine.</p>

<p>This is useful when doing updates of the server code where
the WinPCS server needs to be stopped, having its files replaced,
and then restarted. </p>

<h2>Components and files</h2>
<p>The whole thing consists of the following three
executable files:

WINPCSSV.EXE<br>
SSPROD.EXE<br>
WINPCSCL.DLL<br>
</p>

<p>The server itself is WINPCSSV.EXE and this is a complete EXE file
that require no non-system DLLs to run. It may be run as a console 
program or as a service, and it contains the means to install, start, 
and remove itself.  When invoked without arguments, it gives the 
following messages about how to use it:</p>

<pre>
WinPCSSV -install        to install the service
WinPCSSV -start          to start the installed service
WinPCSSV -instart        to install and start the service
WinPCSSV -remove         to remove the service
WinPCSSV -cmdline        to run as a console app on the commandline
</pre>

<p>This is normally installed as a service, by issuing 
<b>WINPCSSV -install</b> or <b>WINPCSSV -instart</b> and left
to run until the server shuts down. Once installed it will appear in the
list of services and may be given "Automatic startup" status there.</p>

<p>Upon start, it reads settings from a file WINPCSSV.TXT if that 
file exists. It writes this file whenever one of the parameters are 
changed, and remembers them that way. The file is really only to be
written and read by the super-server, and it is painful to try and change
things in it manually. Don't bother, use ssprod instead.  </p>

<p>The super-server must be running on the same machine as 
the WinPCS server. It does not have the capability of starting a program
such as W31SVR.EXE on a different machine from the one it runs on itself. 
The super-server also only knows how to deal with the WinPCS Server and
the Tablet-handling Client. It does not know how to deal with any other
local programs and is non-configurable in this respect. This also means that
all paths referenced are local to the server machine and do not require any
drive mapping in the network or any such. </p>

<h2>Operation</h2>
<a name="Operation"> </a> 
To access the server, the SSPROD.EXE (super-server prodding) 
program is run. This also operates on the command-line, and may tell
the super-server to start or stop one of the 4 WinPCS server or the 
tablet-handling clients. ssprod can be run from any client machine
with network access to the server program, and is the normal way of interfacing 
to it. The SSPROD.EXE and the WINPCSCL.DLL may be copied onto some client 
machine and run from there, obviating the need for mapping drives to the server 
also under these circumstances. The only communications link the two need
is the collection of RPC calls done via WINPCSCL.DLL to the server program. </p>

<p>ssprod has the following command-line arguments:
<pre>
ssprod servername -vlgh -p name -d path -s path -c path -m name -a path
   servername      name of the server to connect to
   -v              tell about versions
   -l              lists the known programs' names
   -p w31svr1      handle the winpcs server program for Project 1
   -p tabhcli1     handle the tablet-handling program for Project 1
   -g              Start the program
   -h              stop the program
   -d path         Set server executable file's directory
   -q path         Set path for the stop command
   -s path         Set server's working directory
   -c path         Set client's working directory
   -m name         Set machine name or IP-address
   -a path         Set additional optional path-info
</pre></p>

<p>For the other three projects, number 2, 3, or 4, the suffix digit on the
to the -p arguments can be changed to w31svr2, w31svr3, tabhcli2, etc. The idea 
is that there can be up to 4 different projects running on one server, with 
independent server processes
and we will want to start and stop them independently of each other.</p>

<p>Generally, as examples, to start the WinPCS server for Project 1 
on a machine named krld610 the command is
<pre>ssprod krld610 -p w31svr1 -g</pre>
and to stop it it is: 
<pre>ssprod krld610 -p w31svr1 -h</pre></p>

<h2>Paths</h2>

<p>There are 4 paths and the machine-name that need to be 
set for it to handle the WinPCS server:</p>

<p>1. The server executable file's directory. This is where the
W31SVR.EXE file is or will be. For example, if it is for the Project 1
in the directory I:\server31 on the machine named krld610:</p>

<pre>ssprod krld610 -p w31svr1 -d i:\server31</pre>

<p>Note how the arguments to SSPROD invocations identify the machine, 
the program and some setting to apply to it. </p>

<p>2. The stop-server program requires the name or IP-address of
the machine. This is similar to the argument to ssprod, but there
may be instances where the naming resolution does not work, and we
must use the IP-address.  To set this name, use the -m argument: </p>

<pre>ssprod krld610 -p w31svr1 -m krld610</pre>

<p>3. The stop-server program's executable file's directory. 
This is where the W31STOP.EXE file is or will be. This is usually
the same as the the directory for the server program.  Example
for the same machine as above:</p>

<pre>ssprod krld610 -p w31svr1 -q i:\server</pre>

<p>4. The WinPCS server also needs to find its ANCHORS.DLL file, this
directory is the server's system directory. This is typically called
SERVER and is a sibling of the ordinary project-specific DATA, INI, 
SYSTEM32, and the rest of the lot. For the example machine KRLD610 where 
this is located in J:\united\server, the command-line is: </p>

<pre>ssprod krld610 -p w31svr1 -s j:\united\server</pre>

<p>5. On versions of the WinPCS servers, earlier than 
W31svr.exe Build 728, 28 June 2004, the 
the "stop WinPCS server program" uses the client-side ANCHORC.DLL. 
This requires the version 1.5 or earlier of the Super-Server, for it
to stop it correctly. Of course, the manual way of stopping by calling
w31stop.exe from a client is still possible independent of the super-server,
except that it may think the winpcs server is still running and may have to
have a stop command issued before allowing the server to restart.</p>

<p>Later versions, from Build 728, 28 June 2004 and onwards, use the server-side
ANCHORS.DLL instead. These do not need to know about the client directory
at all. </p>

<pre>ssprod krld610 -p w31svr1 -c j:\united\system32</pre>

<p>6. On some systems, the path to the Pervasive or Btrieve engine might
not have been set, and there is an additional way of specifying an 
additional path element in this case: </p>

<pre>ssprod krld610 -p w31svr1 -a c:\pvsw\bin</pre>

<p>To clear any of these paths, use the argument <b>(none)</b> for them; the system will
then wipe it out: </p>

<pre>ssprod krld610 -p w31svr1 -a c:\pvsw\bin</pre>

<p>To check what the current settings for the winpcs server, W31SVR, 
are, use the <b>-l</b> command:

<pre>ssprod krld610 -p w31svr1 -l</pre>

<p>and it will tell about the various paths and commands.  
If necessary, these may be changed at any time.  Whenever changes are 
being made, these will be stored in the WINPCSSV.TXT file where they can
be re-read on a later start.  This file is not read at other times. Do not
depend on being able to edit this file -- newer versions of ssprod and winpcssv.exe will
want to rewrite the file in new ways, and no guarantee of cross-version
compatibility will be given. The file is used by the super-server to remember 
the path settings.</p>

<h2>Start and Stop</h2>

<p>The WinPCS server may now be started by issuing</p>

<pre>ssprod krld610 -p w31svr1 -g</pre>

<p>If this comes up with some error messages about a path not found, 
the missing path may be added. If this is successful, the list of 
running programs in Task Manager should display the entry named 
"w31svr.exe" and the WinPCS client should be able to locate the 
running server and access it.</p>

<p>To stop the WinPCS server, the command </p>

<pre>ssprod krld610 -p w31svr1 -g</pre>

<p>will cause it to halt. This can be checked by noting the absence of the
entry in the Task Manager List.  Once stopped, DLL files for the server
can be removed and replaced as desired, before the server is started again.</p>

<p>Should the WinPCS server crash, the stop-command must still be given,
so as to clear the memory of the server, before it is attempted restarted. </p>

<h1>View Report Pre and Post Processing -- Category 12</h1> <p> 


<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>These functions are called once each at the beginning and end of a Status Index.  When 
several trunk items are examined, these functions are also called between the items. 
Thus the calling order is: Before( ), then the SI is run, with any field callback functions 
being called as desired. Then the After( ) function is called. 
This Before( )-data-After( ) sequence is repeated for every different Trunk item.</p>

<h3>Enabling control in WinPCS:</h3>
<p>$before= and $after= in STATREES.INI refer to the functions to be called before and 
after the top level. There are also $between# definitions, for functions to be called 
between each new object on each numbered level.</p>

<h3>Disallowed functions:</h3>
<p>DDE callback and document-drawing functions are only available inside the DDE 
callback and Printing callback environments.  There is however no restrictions on 
initiating printing or DDE-operations.</p>

<h3>LCX files:</h3>
<p>Files are referenced in SI= entries in WinPCS.INI, [RCONN] section. </p>

<h3>Callback functions:</h3>
before( )<br/>
item_callback( )<br/>
after( )<br/>

<p>No specific return value for before( ) and after( ). The $between#( ) function's return 
value will be shown in the field associated with the $between# function. The before( ) 
function may set up global variables that may be used by the between( ), item_callback( 
) and after( ) functions.</p>

<h3>Execution context:</h3>
<p>Shared with Category 9 -- Status callback functions. Also Re-entered. The before 
function, then  the Status callback functions, then the after function are called in this 
order in the one and same execution  context, as many times as there are different Trunk 
level objects to report status on.</p>

<h1>WinPCS on Tablets</h1>

This document describes how WinPCS on Tablets operates. There are 3 
processes involved beside the usual WinPCS server and regular client, and 
these cooperate thru files and RPC.  On the Tablet, the Tablet-interface 
server program, TABIFCSV, runs in the background, and reacts to 
requests initiated by the tablet-handling Client, TABHCLI, which 
runs on a server, and is in turn a client of WinPCS, and has access to 
the data and the tables within.  TABHCLI continually checks for tablets
present and when it finds one, it will interrogate that tablet's TABIFCSV
for the need of any status downloads and data uploads. At certain times,
the TABHCLI starts a special status-index report the output of which
is to be uploaded to the tablets, so the users there can run the offline
version of WinPCS, TWLITE, there.  Working within TWLITE, the user sets 
status on check-sheets, punchitems, and notes, and may also add more 
punchitems or notes.   These status changes are saved and will be 
downloaded by TABHCLI the next time the tablet is accessible on the network. 


<h2>TWLITE: The WinPCS Tablet version</h2>
This is called TWLITE, and it runs much like the usual WinPCS Client, 
as an MDI-window with children inside, but since it does not access the
server, its functionality is limited to browsing one or more uploaded 
files through a hierarchy-view, and viewing and changing status on 
selected status-carrying objects.   

<p>Directories: TSYSTEM TDATA

<p>Files: <br>
<li>TWLITE.EXE and other WinPCS client DLL files - 
	The tablet WinPCS executable</li>
<li>TDATA\hierdata.csv - One of several hierarchy data files</li>
<li>TDATA\hierdata.ini - Mapping INI file for each of the 
	hierarchy data files</li>
<li>TDATA\STATUS.CSV - The status-log file generated on the tablet</li>
<li>TSYSTEM\PCSD.INI - Menu specification</li>
<li>TSYSTEM\PCSD.LCX - Menu LCX file actions </li>
<li>TSYSTEM\DDMATRIX.INI - DDMATRIX replacement data file</li>
<li>TSYSTEM\CXDICT.CSV - CXDICT replacement data file</li>

<p>Other reference data-files replacing tables of similar 
names and purposes.  These are mostly used for validating 
the status-dialogs:

<li>TSYSTEM\PLDISP.CSV - Punch List and Note disciplines</li>
<li>TSYSTEM\REFINSP.CSV - Inspector IDs</li>
<li>TSYSTEM\PLCONTRACT.CSV - Punch List Contract numbers</li>
<li>TSYSTEM\REFSITE.CSV - Site-codes</li>

<p>Referenced files from the hierdata.ini and DDMATRIX.INI:
<li>TSYSTEM\THAND.LCX - Handles the creation of notes and punchitems.</li>
<li>TDATA\CLISTS.LCX - Handles status-setting on existing objects. </li>
<li>TDATA\TWORD.LCX - Handles opening of Word in check-sheets. </li>

<h3>Replacements of DDMATRIX and CXDICT</h3>
Since DDMATRIX lookups for hierarchies and the CXDICT general table 
information are handled by the WinPCS server, there are non-server 
replacements for these. The ways the two tables are searched and
read indicated that DDMATRIX was best implemented as an INI file, 
and CXDICT as a CSV file. The contents of the CXDICT CSV file is
simply a CSV-format copy of the main systems' CXDICT table, and it
contains all the same fields and the same data. The column legends
correspond to CXDICT fieldnames, and this file is easiest produced
reading CXDICT using SYNFARE and then saving the contents of that as
the CSV file. 

<p>DDMATRIX.INI is a bit more reduced. It contains a number of sections
corresponding to source tables. Within each is a number of entries where
the key-names are the origin-field-name, target-table-name, and 
target-field-name, and the right-hand sides are the menu-text in a pair
of parentheses, then the relevant LCX files in another pair of parentheses
and finally the LCX-function to be called.  This is produced by heavily
editing a CSV-format dump of DDMATRIX, throwing out a lot of the records
that make no sense on the server-less tablet environment. For the most
part, only the entries having to do with creating notes and punchitems 
need remain. 

<h2>TABIFCSV: Tablet interface server</h2>
This program is an RPC server, which runs in the background on 
each tablet, and is responsible
for replying to requests from TABHCLI for data movements.  It knows how
to send out the STATUS.CSV status-information file, and how to receive the
status-index data files. As these files can be huge, the PKZIP and PKUNZIP
utilities have been harnessed to allow a smaller amount of data to be 
moved across. 

<p>Directories: 

<p>Files: 
<li>TABIFCSV.EXE, and other WinPCS general DLL 
files - These are the executable files for the server.  </li>
<li>PKUNZIP.EXE - the PK-unzip program that the server uses for unpacking
the large status-index CSV files. 
<li>TABIFCSV.INI - configuration file for TABIFCSV.EXE. This has one
entry in it which tells TABIFCSV where to find the data-files of interest:

<p><hr><pre>
[tabifcsv]
data=c:\winpcs\tdata
</pre><hr>

<h2>TABHCLI: The Tablet-handling client</h2>
This program runs in close proximity to the main WinPCS server, and operates
as a client to that, as well as an RPC client to the various tablet's 
TABIFCSV servers.  It contains a main loop, where it checks for tablets,
downloads any data from them, and puts this data into WinPCS.  It also 
will run certain status-indexes at predefined times, and store these for 
uploads to the tablets.  To do this, it runs its jobs in several phases: 
PULL, which gets data from the tablets and stores them on an internal queue;
STUFF, which takes the data from the queue and makes the updates in WinPCS;
SI, which runs the status index reports and stores these as CSV and ZIP 
files on the server, and finally there is PUSH which sends the zipped status 
index data files out to the tablets when this is deemed necessary. 

<p>WinPCS Tables: 
<li>TABLETC - where the details of status indexes and tablets are stored.</li>
<p>Directories: 
<p>TDATA - where the data files are
<p>Files: 
<li>TABHCLI.EXE, TABIFCCL.DLL, other WinPCS client DLL files
<li>PKZIP.EXE - used by TABHCLI to pack the status-index data-files
prior to transmission to tablets</li>
<li>TABHCLI.INI - where it is told where to go look for the ANCHORC.DLL
of WinPCS, and where it is to place the files it exports </li>

<p><hr><pre>

; Here, we need to handle the general data-loading going back in,
; for those things not readily put into STADLG.INI or STATREES.INI
</pre><hr>



<h2>Configuration-tables and data in WinPCS</h2>
The TABLETC table serves as both a table of configuration and a 
form of history.  Records here describe tablets or status-indexes 
to run, and stored the dates and times when these last were 
performed, updated and file downloads occurred.

<p>Beyond this, there is the actual status index definition itself, which
is located in STATREES.INI and STAREP.INI, defined here in the same way
as any other status index.  The difference is that a companion mapping
file for this status index also must be maintained, where the information
about the fields in the report is stored and the specific information for
status up- and down-loading is.

<h3>TABLETC table</h3>
Each record in TABLETC describes a Tablet or a Status-index.
The field SECTION therefore contains one of the two keywords 
TABLETS or TREELINE. Some other keywords may be added, so only
these reserved words should appear. 

<p>The values in the TEXT field give more details. For the TABLETS, this
is simply the machine name of the tablet-PC, so that the TABHCLI may know
to look for it. 

<p>The values in TEXT for status-indexes include a series of name=value 
pairs, on the form:

<pre><b>siname=</b><em>SI-name</em> <b>table=</b><em>start-table</em> <b>store=</b><em>datafilename</em> <b>times=</b><em>time</em>[,<em>time</em>...]</pre>

<p>Here, the meaning of the various elements are:<br>

<tt><b>siname=</b><em>SI-name</em></tt>
refers to a status index report in STATREES.INI. <br>

<tt><b>table=</b><em>start-table</em></tt>
refers to the table to run this status-index report on<br>

<tt><b>store=</b><em>datafilename</em></tt>
identifies the root name of the CSV, INI, and ZIP files used for
the report output data, which is to be transferred to the tablet in 
the Push phase.  <br>

<tt><b>times=</b><em>time</em>[,<em>time</em>...]</tt>
identifies one or more times on the clock when the
SI-report is to be run. 

<p>For example:
<pre><b>siname=TABLETX table=CERTSITE store=TABXREP times=1330,2300</b></pre>

Here, the status-index called TABLETX is run at 
1330 (1.30 PM) and 2300 (11.00 PM) every day, and
the output of this is stored in the file TABXREP.CSV. The zipped
file TABXREP.ZIP will be transferred to tablets in the Push phase.  The
TWLITE on the tablet also must be able to find the the file TABXREP.INI to 
describe the data-file so it can open a Hierarchy on it. 

<p>The other fields indicate the dates and times of some of the activities.
For the SI-report records (where SECTION is TREELINE), the fields UPDATEOKD 
and UPDATEOKT indicate when the status-index was last run successfully. 

<p>For Tablets (where SECTION is TABLETS), the UPDATEOK fields indicate when
the SI-report data last was successfully transferred to that Tablet.  The
DOWNLDOK fields indicate when the status-info file was last read 
successfully off a Tablet, and the LASTATTEMPT indicates when the last 
attempt at communicating with the Tablet was done, whether it was 
successful or not.  UPDATE and DOWNLD are only written on success.

<h2>How Status on objects is done</h2>

There are 2 basic ways of setting and changing status defined: Changing 
status on existing objects and adding new objects such as punchitems and
notes to the system.  There are several similarities between these but also
some basic differences.  In all cases, all changes are recorded in the 
STATUS.CSV file in a format that the TABHCLI can process in its Stuffing 
phase. Both kinds of activities are handled by the Stuff phase where it
calls on help from the macrofunctions referenced in the 
auto= entries in STADLG.INI which are currently found in the file
TDATA\TABLETS.LCX file referred to in winpcs.ini [ ] autofile=

<p>These macro-files makes it possible to move the data into the various
status-carrying tables without having to hard-code any details. This 
Stuff phase of TABHCLI uses many of the non-GUI parts of the WinPCS client
as found in the CWUDLL.DLL, NCONN.DLL, ODOCTL.DLL, LCX97.DLL and LCXCLI.DLL 
libraries, and of course the two DLLS interfacing to the WinPCS server
and the tablets,  NEXUS31.DLL  and TABIFCCL.DLL 

<h3>Changing existing items</h3>

<p>The status-setting of existing items are initiated by double-clicking on 
objects identified as <b>statustables</b> in section <b>[status]</b> in the
data-spec INI file. Another entry in this section describes the general
model of status-setting for this table, and then there are sections defining
the actions for each of these models.  This allows several kinds of 
similarly treated status carriers to be handled the same way and cuts down 
the amount of information required. 

<p>At the moment, there are 3 status-models defined for existing items:
CHSMODEL for Checksheets, PLMODEL for Punchitems, and NOTEMODEL for Notes. 
There is nothing magic or hardcoded about these model names, these are 
referenced only from the entries in the <b>[status]</b> section.

<p>Each model defines a status-dialog, with a number of state-buttons,
status values, and optional additional fields for entering inspector
identities, due dates and suchlike. 

<p>This is reminiscent of the way STADLG.INI operates, with a 
DIALOG= entry for the controls, the numerical status values, and
action functions for get=.  But where STADLG has a SET-function, these
dialogs have a COLLECT= and ACCEPT= function instead. There is also a
reference to macro-files directly here in these dialogs, not in any global 
.INI file. The purpose of the get-function is to prime global variables
prior to displaying the dialog, then the  dialog is displayed and the
initializing function for the controls are run; these may read the globals
that the get= function configured. 

<p>When the OK button on the dialog is clicked, the accept= function is
called, and it determines whether the dialog is completed. If accept= says
something is missing, the OK button will not close the dialog.  To abort
the action, the Cancel button always closes the dialog and clears any 
partial results.

<p>When accept= indicates that the information about dates etc. is complete,
the dialog closes, and the collect= function is called to gather all the 
contents of the status-information for the system to store it into the
status-log file, STATUS.CSV.  The data is stored in a large field formatted
as a LCX set with elements on the form NAME=value, and these are later 
interpreted by the Autoset-functions run by the Stuff phase. 

<h3>Adding new items</h3>
The addition of another punchitem or note is initiated by a right-click 
on the object in the hierarchy which is to receive the punchitem 
or note, and selecting the menu-choice for adding punchitem or note.

<p>A function in the file specified in the relevant part of DDMATRIX.INI
will be called to perform the status creation. Typically, this will make 
a call to the wildstatus() system function, which opens a status-dialog,
similar in design to the ones seen on double-clicks. Like the status-
changing dialogs, this dialog features a number of state-buttons, a
number of additional controls, and the get=, accept=, and collect= functions,
which are all orchestrated to receive the required information from the 
user.  Once this has been received, the function will pass the returned
values into the system-provided FHStatus() function to have it 
record the data in the STATUS.CSV logfile, in a manner similar to the
status-setting information.

<h2>TABHCLI Pull phase: Detecting tablets and obtaining data from them</h2>

One thread in the TABHCLI sits and waits for tablets to appear. When one 
is discovered, it is interrogated about whether it has any data in its
STATUS.CSV. If so, the contents of this file is read off the tablet and
into TABHCLI, where it first is stored in memory in its entirety. 

<p>Should the connection to the tablet drop out at any time 
before the reading is completed, the 
partially received data is forgotten by TABHCLI and remains on the tablet 
to be read the next time. Only when the tablet has been properly dismissed
from TABHCLI, will the TABIFCSV on the tablet erase the tablet's STATUS.CSV
file, while on TABHCLI, the Pull phase puts the items received on an 
internal queue in the order received.  

<h2>TABHCLI Stuff phase: Updating WinPCS</h2>

While Pull services the tablets and fills the queue, the Stuff 
phase reads items off the queue and places them into WinPCS. 
The access to the queue is controlled by a mutex, so Push writing to
the queue and Stuff reading off the queue do not get in the way of 
each others.

<p>Each record is a CSV-format data set with a number of standard elements 
up front and a tail of variying length and contents, which
came from the collection-functions. 

<p>To perform its job, Stuff relies on information in
STATREES.INI and details in macro-files and system tables to perform 
the actual insertions and updates, as well as renumbering provisional 
punch-lists and notes when they are created and connected. This is probably 
the most complicated and error-prone part of the whole loop. Anything that 
Stuff cannot dispose of correctly must be recorded in an error-log table,
and someone may have to take a look at this error-log table 
occasionally.

<p>The macro-files run by Stuff are referenced in STADLG.INI entries, as
the auto= functions there, and the file is referenced in WinPCS.INI.

<h2>TABHCLI SI phase: Running SI reports</h2>
SI-reports are run in the same time-line as Stuff, so that the system 
is either running SI-reports or processing data from the queue. 
While SI-reports are running there are no updates taking place, and 
anything collected by the Pull phase in the meantime will be stored 
on the queue for later processing. The SI reporting also stops the 
Push phase from updating data on the tablets.

<h2>TABHCLI Push phase: Updating Tablets</h2>
Similar to Pull, but operating in the other direction, this phase is
initiated by Pull, after Pull has emptied out the data from the tablet, 
and the tablet is still present, and it has not recently been updated, 
and the SI phase is not active and producing a status-index.  

<p>This phase checks for the need for any updates and does them only
if a need is detected. 

<p>To this end, the detection mechanism uses the times of the 
last recorded successful
Push-action or tablet-update and compares this to the last successful 
SI, status-index run and stored.  If the latest SI is more recent, 
than the latest Push action, the file for that status index will be updated. 

<p>An alternative would be to check the ZIP-files, however, this is
susceptible to errors when the clock on the tablet runs different
from the clock on the main machine, so this option has not been taken. 

<p>Push shares a thread with Pull, since both of them deal with tablets 
and Push is independent of the Stuff phase, much like Pull and SI are 
independent of each other as well.

<h2>Installation</h2>
The various components are files copied into two directories, one
is the "system" directory for the standalone tablet program, conventionally
called TSYSTEM; the other is the "data" directory, typically called TDATA,  
where the status.csv and the other data-files are located.  These names are 
not hardcoded in any executable files, but they must be referenced in the
INI files for the four programs: TWLITE, TABHCLI, TABIFCSV, and W31SVR.

<p>The relevant places are:
TABHCLI.INI
TABIFCSV.INI
TSYSTEM\CLIENT.INI
SYSTEM31\WINPCS.INI

<h3>TWLITE</h3>
This consists of a set of WinPCS client files where the starting
executable is TWLITE.EXE instead of WINPCS.EXE, and this is set to use the
TSYSTEM directory. The files here are to some extent a subset of the
standard SYSTEM32 directory, where the ANCHORC.DLL, PCSD.INI, 
WINPCS.INI, and CLIENT.INI all have the same functions and meaning 
as in the regular WinPCS client. 

<p>To install, the files of TDATA and TSYSTEM are to be copied to a
suitable place on the tablet, including the ANCHORC.DLL.  The WinPCS
files are to go into another directory. 

<h3>TABIFCSV</h3>
This is a command-line program that may be installed as a service 
or run in a console window.  TABIFCSV -cmdline does this. 

<p>If desiring to run it as a service, you must be an administrator,
and use TABIFCSV -install to install and TABIFCSV -start
to start it. TABIFCSV -instart does both.

The "WinPCS Tablet handling Server" will now appear in the Windows 
list of services, and once installed and started, it may be set 
to Automatic startup there  

<p>To remove it, use TABIFCSV -remove, again you must be administrator
to do this. 

<p>To know where to look for its data files, it needs an INI file,
named TABIFCSV.INI, in the same directory, with a section [tabifcsv]
and the entry data= referring to the directory where it is to put its 
files, for example:

<p><hr><pre>
[tabifcsv]
data=c:\winpcs\tdata
</pre><hr>

<h2>Outstanding issues</h2>
<li>User feedback: when a punchitem or note is created or the status
of some object is set, the change ought to appear in the hierarchy.
This is probably the most important oustanding item, since it breaks
with the way people are used to seeing things happen. 

<li>Looking at sheet-proformas in the form of Word-documents and entering
changes to them.  Finding and showing them isn't too hard, and Word manages
the actual data. Some additional data-items can be

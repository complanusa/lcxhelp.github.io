<h1>CXDICT Filter Functions -- Category 14 (16-bit WinPCS)</h1> <p> 

<h3>Enabling controls</h3>
<p>The functions mentioned here are the ones referred to in the FILTER field 
in CXDICT for any table that requires it. The entire code 
(function definitions, complete with 
brackets and other punctuation) is expected to be in this field, and the 
first function here is expected to be used to generate displayable strings 
for hierarchies. Other functions may be present and called from the first one,
as necessary and as space permits.</p>

<h3>Disallowed functions:</h3>
<p>The form-drawing functions can only be called within the form-drawing contexts.
Starting more hierarchies or opening other views is not a good idea either. </p>

<h3>Recommended functions</h3>
<p>Since these functions are frequently being called, they should 
not do much more than simple text-manipulation, using functions such as 
<a href="lcxh.html#substr">substr( )</a>, 
<a href="lcxh.html#concat">concat( )</a>, 
<a href="lcxh.html#julday">julday( )</a>, 
<a href="lcxh.html#caldat">caldat( )</a>, and 
<a href="lcxh.html#setitem">setitem( )</a>. Table-reading functions such as 
<a href="lcxh.html#get">get( )</a> are also useful. </p>

<h3>LCX files:</h3>
<p>There are no files involved, the entire code is found in the 
CXDICT field, and no other code is in scope. </p>

<h3>Callback functions:</h3>
<p><pre><em>text</em><b> = </b><em>thefunction</em><b>(</b><em>itemid</em><b>, </b><em>itemdescription</em><b>)</b></pre></p>

<h3>Arguments:</h3>
<p>The first argument, <em>itemid</em> is the object's identity, tag-number, 
system-number or similar.  The second argument, <em>itemdescription</em> 
is the object's service description, title, or similar.  </p>

<h3>Return Value:</h3>
<p>The return value should be whatever string it is desired to show 
in Hierarchies and VCONN lists.  This need not resolve to any kind of 
unique value, it ends up merely as a descriptive string.</p>

<h3>Default</h3>
<p>When this field of CXDICT is blank, 
the text being output simply is the familiar concatenation of identity and 
description (ITEMFLD and ITEMDESFLD), as if the function were:</p>

<p><pre> 
show(string id, string descr)
{
	return(concat(id, " ", descr));
}
</pre></p>

<h3>Execution context:</h3>
<p>Not shared and not re-entered. </p>

<a href="lcxh.html#concat">concat( )</a>

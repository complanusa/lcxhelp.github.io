<h1>DDMATRIX Reference</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The table DDMATRIX handles all the drag-drop actions
and the right-click menus in the Hierarchies.</p>

<p>Each record in DDMATRIX defines an action function for dragging
from somewhere in WinPCS (or outside WinPCS), the "origin", to 
somewhere else inside WinPCS, the "destination".  
<a href="call0005.html">
There are more details on the LCX side of things here. </a></p>

<h2>Standard tables</h2>
<p>Each record in DDMATRIX identifies a possible object to grab and drag, and a
possible target for this object, where it is dropped, and the action to be done
when this happens. The action is formulated as an LCX function defined in the record.</p>

<p>Each origin and target is defined by specifying a table and a fieldname. In most cases, 
the field is the ITEMFIELD as defined in CXDICT for that table. The objects picked up
can come from DDSERV fields in Views, VCONN lists, and Hierarchies. The target areas are
DDSERV fields, VCONN lists, Hierarchies, and WinPCS Strip Icons. In addition, objects
can be dropped into Gang Connection Selection boxes, but these are part of the Gang Connection,
and nothing to do with DDMATRIX.</p>

<p>The fields in DDMATRIX are as follows:</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="2"> <tbody>

<tr><td>Fieldname</td><td>Standard Description</td>
	<td>File Source</td>
	<td>Strip Drop Targets</td>
	<td>DCLICK Targets</td>
	<td>Strip Click Actions</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>RSERIAL</td><td>The usual Record Number</td> </tr>

<tr><td>ORIGIN</td><td>This identifies the table where the dragged 
object comes from.
 It can be a real table, or the mangled name for 
the variant hierarchies, or the name of the pseudo-table DDFILE for 
files picked up in Explorer windows. See below for more on 
DDFILE. This can also be <b>WinPCS</b> for STRIP icon clicks. 
</td>
<td><b>DDFILE</b></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td><b>WinPCS</b></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>ORIGIN_FIELD</td><td>This is the standard fieldname of the 
origin table, usually the same name as in CXDICT field ITEMFIELD for 
this table, or the starting fieldname for the variant hierarchies. 
When ORIGIN is <b>DDFILE</b>, this field should be 
whatever is defined in CXDICT as the ITEMFIELD for the "table"
DDFILE. Usually this is the string <b>FIELDNAME</b>. When ORIGIN is
<b>WinPCS</b> this should be the name of one of the icons on the 
STRIP.</td>
<td><b>FIELDNAME</b></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td>Strip icon name</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>ORIGIN_BASE</td><td>This is an overlaid copy
of ORIGIN 
on non-SQL systems. SQL systems don't use this field
even if it is present. 
Can be left blank on insertions or updates. </td>
<td><b>DDFILE</b></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td><b>WinPCS</b></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>DESTIN</td><td>This is the table name for the target side, the 
place or object the dragged object is dropped on. This is often <b>WinPCS</b>,
which indicates one of the icons at the bottom of the screen, or it is some
real data table, such as ENGTELE, ENGEQUIP, CERTAC1 etc. For double-clicks in 
hierarchies and clicks on the Strip icons, it indicates that a clicking action
is to be handled. </td>
<td></td> <td><b>WinPCS</b></td> <td><b>DCLICK</b></td> <td><b>CLICK</b></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>DESTIN_FIELD</td><td>This is the ITEMFIELD for the DESTIN
table, the name of the Strip Icon if DESTIN is <b>WinPCS</b>. 
It can also be some indicator of what is expected to happen when some
object in the hierarchy or Strip is clicked on.  
Tags tend to have TAG_NO, systems have SYSTEM_NO, there are also
CABLE_NO, TEST_NO, DOC_NO, and LOOP_NO. Use whatever is the standard 
as found in CXDICT.  </td>
<td></td> <td>Strip icon name</td> <td>one of 
<b>STATUS</b>,<br/><b>OSTATUS</b>,<br/><b>LCXCALL</b>,<br/><b>SERVERLCX</b> </td> 
<td><b>LCXCALL</b></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>DESTIN_BASE</td><td>This is an overlaid copy
of DESTIN on non-SQL systems. SQL systems don't use this field
even if it is present.  Can be left blank on insertions or updates.  </td>
<td></td> <td><b>WinPCS</b></td> <td><b>DCLICK</b></td> <td><b>CLICK</b></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>MAGIC</td><td>In 16-bit systems, this used to be a way of identifying different targets.
This is not used for anything on the 32-bit systems.</td></tr>

<tr><td>WFILE</td><td>This is the usual LCX file where the
action function is to be found. Non-SQL systems may have this field named FILE</td></tr>

<tr><td>WFUNCTION</td><td>This is the name of the
action function. Since each table has their own record in DDMATRIX, 
various action functions can be used for various tables. Some may want 
documents attached, some may want them inserted or replaced as 
references. The return value is used to indicate how hierarchies are to be re-drawn.
See <a href="call0005.html"> Drag and Drop Actions </a> for details. Non-SQL systems may 
have this field named FUNCTION</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>CURSOR</td><td>This used to define the cursor that WinPCS would use for marking
a possible drop. This is not used anymore.  </td></tr>

<tr><td>MENU_TXT</td><td>This is menu texts on right-clicks
in hierarchies. These are only used for some <b>WinPCS</b> destinations.  See note below.
</td>
<td>N/A</td> <td>Menu Entry</td> <td>N/A</td> <td>N/A</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>SD_COMBO</td><td>This is an overlaid field over ORIGIN, part of a 
4-segment key used for enforcing uniqueness on non-SQL systems. SQL systems
don't need or use this field.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>SD_COMBO1</td><td>This is an overlaid field over ORIGIN_FIELD, part of a 
4-segment key used for enforcing uniqueness on non-SQL systems. SQL systems
don't need or use this field.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>SD_COMBO2</td><td>This is an overlaid field over DESTIN, part of a 
4-segment key used for enforcing uniqueness on non-SQL systems. SQL systems
don't need or use this field.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>SD_COMBO3</td><td>This is an overlaid field over DESTIN_FIELD, part of a 
4-segment key used for enforcing uniqueness on non-SQL systems. SQL systems
don't need or use this field.</td>
</tr>

<h2>WinPCS Special Hierarchy Sources</h2>
<p>The variant hierarchies as started using the 
<a href="lcxh.html#VarHierarchy">VarHierarchy( )</a> function produces objects defined with
a mangled table name and the name of the field given as <i>distfield</i> for the function. 
More details on the mangling is in the documentation for the 
<a href="lcxh.html#VarHierarchy">VarHierarchy( )</a> function. </p>

<h2>WinPCS Destinations</h2>
<p>The possible drop-targets or destinations on the "Strip" are referenced using the table 
name "WinPCS" for DESTIN instead of a real data table. The DESTIN_FIELD 
is the name of the icon on the strip, as specified in 
<a href="winpcsini.html">WinPCS.INI</a> section
<a href="winpcsini.html#section.20Strip">[STRIP]</a>
and in REFBMP31.INI file (REFBMP.INI file on 16-bit systems). </p>

<p>The setting in winpcs.ini, section <a href="#section.20WinPCS">[WinPCS]</a>
entry <a href="#rightmenu"><b>RIGHTMENU=</b></a> controls if and how these 
menu entries are shown. If RIGHTMENU=DDMATRIX and the field MENU_TXT in DDMATRIX 
is blank, that menu entry will not be displayed.  The drag-drop action itself still works however.</p>

<p>If RIGHTMENU= is not set to DDMATRIX, the text from the Strip will be used here, 
independent of what is in DDMATRIX field MENU_TXT. </p>

<!--- <p>These Strip entries are also what produces the entries in the right-click menu in
the hierarchies. The entries in this menu can come from the description strings on 
the <a href="winpcsini.html#section.20Strip">[STRIP]</a> section or from 
<a href="winpcsini.html">WinPCS.INI</a>
section <a href="#section.20WinPCS">[WinPCS]</a>
entry <a href="#rightmenu"><b>RIGHTMENU=</b></a>. Generally, the actions are generic
here, such as opening a View, opening an Entry, run a Report, perform printing, and so on.</p>
-->

<a name="stripclicks"></a>
<h2>Strip Clicks (<b>WinPCS</b> origin, <b>CLICK:LCXCALL</b> destination)</h2>
<p>When the user left-clicks on the symbols in the WinPCS Strip, there can be records
defined for doing something for these as well. Although not drag-drop related as such, the
DDMATRIX is a natural place to locate these actions as well, as they may be related to
others, and there is already the established convention of referring to the STRIP symbols
with the table name WinPCS and the field-name or object name of the icon. </p>

<p>To enable these actions, the origin table-name is set to <b>WinPCS </b> and the origin
field is set to the name of the strip symbol. The destination table is set to CLICK and 
the destination field is set to LCXCALL,
similar to what we see with the double-click actions from the hierarchies. 
Unlike these, the only supported combination is CLICK and LCXCALL (no DCLICK or STATUS
variations here.  </p>

<p>The WFILE and WFUNCTION identifies the LCX file and the function to be run when the click
is made. This function follows the same standard as other DDMATRIX functions, which are rather
different from the pushbutton functions seen in Reports or Views.</p>

<a name="doubleclicks"></a>

<h2><b>DCLICK</b> destinations: WinPCS Double-Click actions (32-bit only)</h2>
<p>This is a way to define what happens on double-clicking on some tag
or object in a VCONN or hierarchy.  The default in VCONN lists and 
hierarchies where there is a S: setting is to open the status dialog, 
but another action that may be desired is to run some LCX function. </p>

<p>Old status dialogs handled this by stealing the OnGet function
and using that for the LCX action, but when these are run on the 
server the old actions won't be possible. Instead, the LCXCALL 
mode is now provided to do this explicitly.</p>

<p>To specify these actions, the field DESTIN is set to contain the 
string "DCLICK", and the following values of DESTIN_FIELD will 
have meaning as shown: </p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="2"> <tbody>
<tr><td>DESTIN_FIELD</td><td>Meaning</td></tr>
<tr><td>STATUS</td><td>Run the optimized status dialog</td></tr>
<tr><td>OSTATUS</td><td>Run the original model of status dialog</td></tr>
<tr><td>LCXCALL</td><td>Run the LCX function indicated in FUNCTION and
found in FILE on the client</td></tr>
<tr><td>SERVERLCX</td><td>Run the LCX function indicated in FUNCTION on 
the server. As server-side functions are all in the same code space,
the field FILE is not referenced and can be leftblank.</td></tr>
</tbody> </table>

<p>See the <a href="call0001.html">Get and Set Status functions</a> page
for more details on the get and set functions.</p>

<p>The LCXCALL function has the standard DDMATRIX arguments and return
value, see <a href="call0005.html">Drag and Drop actions</a>. </p>

<h2>File Manager and Explorer sources (32-bit only)</h2>
<p>The objects dragged and dropped into WinPCS may come from the Explorer
windows outside of WinPCS. The possible targets are the Strip, the Hierarchies, and
the VCONN lists but unlike dragged objects from within WinPCS, there is no
standard make-connection action in VCONN. The actions are handled via DDMATRIX
for all these targets.</p>

<p>The file-system objects are handled as coming from the pseudo-table
DDFILE, and uses CXDICT to figure out the ITEMFIELD from this table, just
like all other real tables.  The relevant record in CXDICT therefore has
the following values:</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="2"> <tbody>
<tr><td>CXDICT field</td><td>Value</td><td>Comment</td></tr>
<tr><td>ITEMBASE</td><td>DDFILE</td><td>This is the name defined in the code</td></tr>
<tr><td>ITEMFIELD</td><td>FILENAME</td><td>Any name here will do, as long
as it appears the same in DDMATRIX</td></tr>

<tr><td>ITEMUNIFIELD</td><td>RSERIAL</td><td>This is a don't care value, 
though tradition suggests using RSERIAL</td></tr>

<tr><td>ITEMDESFLDS</td><td>FILENAME</td><td>Description field should be 
the same as the ITEMFIELD, it makes StdField() calls meaningful. </td></tr>
<tr><td>ITEMDFCOUNT</td><td>1</td><td>There is 1 description field as usual</td></tr>
<tr><td>ITEMICON</td><td>BMFILE</td><td>Fixed icon name</td></tr>
<tr><td>ITEMICONMODE</td><td>C</td><td>C means ITEMICON is a value, not a fieldname.</td></tr>
<tr><td>ISCORED</td><td>N</td><td>There is nothing to put in CORE. We don't want to to even try.</td></tr>

<tr><td>BASEDESCR</td><td>Dropped Files Pseudo-table</td><td>Describes what this is, 
suitable for 
<a href="lcxh.html#StdField">StdField( )</a> 
calls elsewhere.</td></tr>
</tbody> </table>

<p>There is then one record in DDMATRIX with the above table and its ITEMFIELD
as the source, and the dropped-on table and its ITEMFIELD defined as 
the target. A DDMATRIX entry for drops on ENGTELE is typically 
something like:</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="2"> <tbody>
<tr><td>DDMATRIX field</td><td>Value</td><td>Comment</td></tr>
<tr><td>ORIGIN</td><td>DDFILE</td><td>The pseudo-table for 
Windows-origin files</td></tr>
<tr><td>ORIGIN_FIELD</td><td>FILENAME</td><td>This is the same name 
as in CXDICT field ITEMFIELD. As noted above, any name will do as 
long as it is the same. </td></tr>
<tr><td>ORIGIN_BASE</td><td>DDFILE</td><td>This is an overlaid copy
of ORIGIN. Can be left blank on insertions or updates.  </td></tr>

<tr><td>DESTIN</td><td>ENGTELE</td><td>This is the example for Telecom Tags.
Any other table that wants to handle documents dropped on it should have
a record like this in DDMATRIX with its name here.  The Strip Targets will have the
tablename <b>WinPCS</b> here.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>DESTIN</td><td>TAG_NO</td><td>This is the ITEMFIELD for the DESTIN
table. Tags tend to have TAG_NO, systems have SYSTEM_NO, there are also
CABLE_NO and LOOP_NO. Use whatever is the standard as found in CXDICT.
The Strip targets will have the field-name from the Strip icon, as detailed
for Strip targets above.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>MAGIC</td><td>331</td><td>This is just some number.</td></tr>
<tr><td>FILE</td><td>autodoc.lcx</td><td>This is the usual file where the
action function is to be found.</td></tr>
<tr><td>FUNCTION</td><td>OnDroppedFile</td><td>This is the name of the
action function. Since each table has their own record in DDMATRIX, 
various action functions can be used for various tables. Some may want 
documents attached, some may want them inserted or replaced as 
references.</td></tr>
<tr><td>CURSOR</td><td>VOIDDROP</td><td>This is irrelevant, Windows uses
its own cursors, which are somewhat different from the ones WinPCS uses.  </td></tr>

<tr><td>MENU_TXT</td><td>(blank)</td><td>This is menu texts on right-clicks
in hierarchies. Irrelevant, since these files do not come from 
hierarchies at all.  </td></tr>

</tbody> </table>

<p>An example action function, OnDroppedFile(), is shown here. It has the
usual arguments, but doesn't do anything except display them.</p>

<pre>
/* autodoc.lcx -- capture drops for document files from Explorer windows
	dropped onto hierarchies and VCONN lists. */ 

/*D*/ OnDroppedFile(string uF_group, string base, string uF_icon, string item,
	string uT_group, string uT_type, string uT_icon, string uT_name,
	string uorigin, string uhierinfo)
{

	message(__HERE__, "\x0a uF_group = ", uF_group,
		"\x0a base = ", base,
		"\x0a uF_icon = ", uF_icon,
		"\x0a item = ", item,
		"\x0a uT_group = ", uT_group,
		"\x0a uT_type = ", uT_type,
		"\x0a uT_icon = ", uT_icon,
		"\x0a uT_name = ", uT_name,
		"\x0a uorigin = ", uorigin,
		"\x0a uhierinfo = ", uhierinfo);

	return(0);
}
</pre>

<p>The possible return values from these functions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>0 = Don't refresh the hierarchy. </li>
<li>1 = Refresh the appearance of the item. Typical case is when changing status of preservation items or check-sheets. </li>
<li>2 = Close and re-open the item. Typical use of this is creation of punch-items.</li>
<li>3 = Close and re-open the parent of the item. Typical case is changing status of punch-items 
that may affect the appearance of the parent and sibling objects.</li>
<li>4 = Close and re-open the entire hierarchy. Typical case is when 
preservation schedule has to change. </li> 
</ul>

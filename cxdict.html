<h1>CXDICT Reference</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2> 
<p>The table CXDICT
contains the system guide to standard fields in all tables.
There is one record per table, like FLOC, and a number of
fieldnames referenced in each of these records. 
The CXDICT table can be accessed as any other table, or more 
usefully through the specialized 
<a href="lcxh.html#StdField">StdField( )</a> function.
This applies to the 16-bit or 32-bit WinPCS versions
as noted here. </p>
<p>CXDICT is cached in the server, and parts of it will be cached in the client, 
as needed. To re-load, the server should have CXDICT reloaded, or the server should
be re-started, and the client must be re-started. In the 32-bit systems, having a
reference in CXDICT is just about mandatory; views, View connections, and Drag-drop
actions will not start without a record present in CXDICT.</p>

<h2>Layout</h2> 

<a name="CXDICT_20LAYOUT"/>
<p>The fields in CXDICT are as follows:</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="2"> <tbody>
<tr><td>Fieldname</td><td>Description</td></tr>
<tr><td>RSERIAL</td><td>The usual Record Number</td></tr>
<tr><td>ITEMBASE</td><td> The table name. Many other CXDICT fields 
	refer to fieldnames in this table.  </td></tr>

<tr><td>ITEMFLD</td><td>
The name of the main single key in the table. In an 
	engineering index it will be the tag number, in a document list it is 
	the document number and so on. The system expects this to be a 
	key field, which is non-duplicateable. </td></tr>

<tr><td>ITEMUNIFLD</td><td>
The name of a field identifying the internal unique
	record number, very commonly the name RSERIAL. This is normally the name of 
	an auto-increment key field,
	which is by its nature restricted to be a single non-duplicateable
	integer. Tables without such a field may not be connected using the
	standard RCONN functions and may not need this field. In this case, it
	should be left blank.  </td></tr>

<tr><td>ITEMRELFLD</td><td>
The name of a field in the table, or blank. This can be used for
	limiting the visibility of records in the table, based on matching
	values of the field indicated here to the value of the currently 
	logged-in user's SITE_CODE in their record in WUSER.  When the value
	of ITEMRELFLD is blank, the records in this table will not be limited
	in the hierarchies.  </td></tr>

<tr><td>ITEMDESFLDS</td><td>
One or more fieldnames with a space between them. These
	fields are made available for use as description fields, and usually
	there is only one of them, (some LCX functions currently extant may
	expect this). The field does not have to be a key. 
</td></tr>

<tr><td>ITEMDFCOUNT</td><td>
ITEMDFCOUNT is the number of fieldnames in the ITEMDESFLDS.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>DEFAULTICON</td><td>
A string naming a default icon.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>ITEMICON</td><td>
Depending on the ITEMICONMODE, this is 
either the name of the field in 
itembase where the bitmap name is held,  or
the name of the bitmap itself
</td></tr>
<tr><td>ITEMICONMODE</td><td>
ITEMICONMODE is either F indicating that the ITEMICON is a field-name, or C
indicating that ITEMICON is the actual icon name.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>ISCORED</td><td>
A Yes/No value. When it is Y, y, J, or j; the activity in 
	the itembase will be logged in CEVENT and CORE. If it is any other value
	(usually N), the itembase probably contains information of reference 
	nature, which does not have to be placed in CORE, but the use of
	CXDICT might still be required or desirable, for example by RCONN.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>KEEPFLD</td><td>
The field where a company code or owner name is held. This
	field is used in the Import and Exception Reporting ("Standard Import").
</td></tr>

<tr><td>BASEDESCR</td><td>
The BASEDESCR field holds a descriptive text of the objects in the table.
This should be in singular form, for example "Cable", or "Subsystem". 
</td></tr>

<tr><td>WFILTER</td><td>
This is blank or it can contain an entire LCX function that takes the
	values of the ITEMFLD and ITEMDESFLDS as arguments and returns a string
	to be displayed in Hierarchies.  Some older systems use FILTER instead
	for this name, but as that is an SQL reserved keyword, newer systems have
	the initial W. The default function, that is, if the
	WFILTER field is absent (as it is on older systems) or it is present
	and blank, is the equivalent of
<pre>
	show(string id, string descr)
	{
		return(concat(id, " ", descr));
	}
</pre>
This WFILTER is mostly used with Hierarchies, to generate the visible 
strings there. See <a href="call3214.html">CXDICT Filter Functions</a> 
for more details on this function.
</td></tr>
</tbody> </table>

<h2>Reading CXDICT</h2> 

<p>The function 
<a href="lcxh.html#StdField">StdField(itemtable, <em>cxdictfieldname</em>)</a> 
is the preferred way to uses to examine and read cached values of 
the fields in CXDICT. </p>

<p>In addition, the general <a href="lcxh.html#findexact">findexact( )</a> 
function may be used on CXDICT, followed by <a href="lcxh.html#get">get( )</a> 
or <a href="lcxh.html#multiget">multiget( )</a> 
calls for the fieldnames. However, this is a lot more inefficient on 
the network and thus not recommended; use 
<a href="lcxh.html#StdField">StdField( )</a> instead.</p>

<p>The possible values for the the <em>cxdictfieldname</em> 
argument to the StdField function are:</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="2"> <tbody>
<tr><td><em>cxdictfieldname</em>     </td><td>returned value        </td></tr>
<tr><td>ISCORED    </td><td>"0" or "1"            </td></tr>
<tr><td>WFILTER     </td><td>Text of the WFILTER field. Note that this is not the 
	result of any LCX function but the function itself. The interpretation of this
	in calls to other functions are done within the system. </td></tr>
<tr><td>ITEMBASE   </td><td>Table name            </td></tr>
<tr><td>ITEMDESFLD </td><td>One or more fieldnames</td></tr>
<tr><td>ITEMDESFLDS</td><td>One or more fieldnames</td></tr>
<tr><td>ITEMFLD    </td><td>Main Fieldname        </td></tr>
<tr><td>ITEMFIELD  </td><td>Main Fieldname        </td></tr>
<tr><td>BASEDESCR  </td><td>Item description Text </td></tr>
<tr><td>KEEPFLD    </td><td>Keeper Fieldname      </td></tr>
<tr><td>ITEMUNIFLD </td><td>Unique Fieldname      </td></tr>
<tr><td>ITEMRELFLD </td><td>Visibility-control Fieldname</td></tr>
<tr><td>ITEMICON   </td><td>Icon name or fieldname</td></tr>

</tbody> </table>

<p>These values can also appear with a prefixed # several other 
places, notably in field-specs in 
<!-- <a href="starepini.html">STAREP.INI</a> -->
STAREP.INI and as the field arguments to 
<a href="lcxh.html#ConSelect">ConSelect( )</a>.</p>

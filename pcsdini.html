<h1>PCSD.INI Reference</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The file pcsd.ini defines the structure and contents of the menus
that WinPCS runs. The name is historical: back in the very early days,
when what became WinPCS was a collection of executable programs, the
main part was PCSD.EXE, which with its configuration file would allow
opening of View and Entry screens (EIVIEW.EXE and EIEN.EXE). </p>

<p>Like all ini files, this file contains a number of sections, 
with entries in them.  The section-names generally correspond to
the drop-down menus, and the entries within the sections become 
the entries in the menus. </p>

<h2>Fixed parts of the menu</h2>
<p>The dropdown menus <em>System</em>, <em>Edit</em>, <em>Window</em>, 
and <em>Help</em>, are standard and
hardcoded, and for the most part are not controlled by the entries
in PCSD.INI. However, the <em>System/Run</em> sub-menu can be populated from
the <b>[Run]</b> section in pcsd.ini, and there can be additional items
added to the <em>Help</em> menu from entries in a section <b>[Help]</b>.</p>

<p>The presence and absence of other items in the System and Edit menus
can be controlled wholesale via entries in 
<a href="winpcsini.html#section.20Menu">the <b>[MENU]</b> section in 
winpcs.ini</a>.  </p>

<p>All other sections in the pcsd.ini file become top-level or sub-level
drop-down menus. </p>

<h2>Entries format</h2>

<p>All menu entries have the same general format, beginning with the text
to be shown as the menu item as the name of the entry, much like the 
section-names also are the texts shown for the drop-down menus. </p>

<pre>
<em>text</em><b>=</b><em>file</em> <em>action</em> <em>arguments</em>
<em>text</em><b>=</b><em>file</em> <em>action</em><b>(</b><em>icon</em><b>)</b> <em>arguments</em>
</pre>

<p>The <em>file</em> is a reference to a file, this is the INI file for
a View or Entry, an LCX-file for running LCX functions, or the help-file
or executable file to be opened and run. What is to be done with the file
is determined by the <em>action</em> value. An optional icon to be shown
in the menu, making it prettier and more user-friendly, is then included
in a set of parentheses right after the action code. Following this are
additional required arguments for the particular action: Views have to refer
to some table, and LCX-calls have to identify the function to be run. </p>

<p>The following action-codes are defined and currently in use:</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="2"> <tbody>

<tr><td>Action</td><td>Description</td>
<td>Arguments</td>
<td>Example</td></tr>

<tr><td>L</td><td>Run an LCX function</td>
<td>LCXfunction, then any string to be passed to the function</td>
<td>LCX Info=0:\openfile.lcx L(WINPCS) ShowHTML http://lcxhelp.com</td></tr>

<tr><td>La</td><td>Run an LCX function in a separate thread</td>
<td>LCXfunction, then any string to be passed to the function</td>
<td>Tags without check-sheets=0:\tagcheck.lcx La(BMTAG) TagChecks </td></tr>

<tr><td>L/</td><td>Run the LCX function in response to the user typing the forward slash, for the purpose of searching.</td>
<td>LCXfunction, then any string to be passed to the function</td>
<td>Search for Item=0:\winpcs.lcx L/(CORE) FindTag2</td></tr>

<tr><td>V</td><td>Open a View on some table</td>
<td>The table to be Viewed.</td>
<td>Master Equipment=6:VEQUIP.INI V(ENGEQUIP) ENGEQUIP</td></tr>

</tbody></table>

<p>Addtitionally, these actions were once defined but have fallen
out of use, since the LCX functions are much more flexible:</p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="2"> <tbody>
<tr><td>Action</td><td>Description</td></tr>
<tr><td>E</td><td>Open Entry on some table, syntax is similar to the one for Views.</td></tr>
<tr><td>H</td><td>Open a Help file. No arguments. Obsolete as we are no longer writing .hlp files.</td></tr>
<tr><td>X</td><td>Run some executable file.</td></tr>

</tbody></table>

<p>The file-reference can be, and usually is, given with the numbered drive, as defined in CLIENT.INI, 
so the actual location in the file-system at any one time will not matter. See 
<a href="lcxh.html#ExpandPath">ExpandPath( )</a> for details.</p>

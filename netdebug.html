<title>Debugging through a network link</title>

<h1>Debugging through a network link</h1>

<p>File Date: 2022-02-22</p>

<p>During development and testing of WinPCS, an important mechanism 
for performing trace-printing has been through a serial line. The machines
running the server and client programs both may have had a serial link
with information running in it, for seeing what is happening. </p>

<p>On deployment, ideally, the trace-printing facility is not needed, 
and to this end, the output from the client or the server may be controlled
with Debug= entries in their INI files.  This works fine as long as 
everything is operating properly, but when crashes and problems are apparent,
there needs to be a way of inspecting these messages even in a production 
system on the customers' site. </p>

<p>The physical server machine in most installations may not be readily 
accessible,  so the usual serial-line trick cannot be done. The remote 
access to start and stop the server is handled through the 
<a href="winpcsmc.html">WinPCS Super-Server</a>, and this program 
can also restart a crashed server.  </p>

<p>But the issue then will be to find out what has made the server crash. 
To this end, recompilation, testing, and trace-printing is important. </p>

<p>Another problem sometimes encountered is the fact that a number of
portables now no longer have an available serial port. Here, some alternative
is needed in these cases as well.  </p>

<h2>TCP or UDP replaces serial</h2>
<p>Recognizing that all these servers and clients operate in a network,
even if this is just one machine with a loopback connection on it, the
the solution was found to be to allow the server and the client to emit 
messages on a network connection. </p>

<p>So instead of emitting to com1 it could emit on
some TCP or UDP port to a listening process on the same or a different machine.</p>

<p>TCP will guarantee everything making it through, but with a performance penalty.
Since TCP works with a connection, WinPCS will want to connect to a <b>netrx</b> listener
at the other end, and if this can't be found, the connection attempt will time out
after some some rather noticeable delay. </p>

<p>For UDP, there is no such guarantee of everything making it through, though on a LAN 
we might expect to see everything. There is, on the other hand, no overhead in setting up
a connection, with UDP, WinPCS just blasts out the message and if there is any <b>udprx</b>
program listening at the other end, it will hear them and display them.  If no <b>udprx</b>
is there, the messages will be ignored. WinPCS will not sit around and wait, so the
speed penalty is a lot less. However, the messages will clutter up the network, so in all
cases, if debugging info is not of interest, they should be turned off. </p>

<!-- <a href="serverini.html#options.debuglevel"> </a> -->
<!-- <a href="serverini.html#options.debug"> </a> -->

<p>To turn TCP or UDP output on, the entry Debug= in the <a href="serverini.html#options.debug">SERVER.INI</a> 
and <a href="winpcsini.html#debug">WINPCS.INI</a> files can be set to one of</p>
<pre>
<b>Debug=net </b><em>ipaddress</em>
<b>Debug=net </b><em>ipaddress</em><b>:</b><em>port</em>
<b>Debug=tcp </b><em>ipaddress</em>
<b>Debug=tcp </b><em>ipaddress</em><b>:</b><em>port</em>
<b>Debug=udp </b><em>ipaddress</em>
<b>Debug=udp </b><em>ipaddress</em><b>:</b><em>port</em>
</pre>
<p>The keywords <b>net</b> and <b>tcp</b> are synonyms, and will make WinPCS emit 
messages using the TCP protocol, 
and the keyword <b>udp</b> will make WinPCS use the UDP protocol. </p>

<p>Alternately, the command-line argument for the client can include the
-N debug-command, with a similar syntax, for example:</p>
<pre>-N "net 192.168.2.107:16381"</pre>
<p>This will override the setting in the WinPCS.INI for this client. </p>

<p>In the above, the <em>ipaddress</em> refers to the ip-address of the machine running one of 
the listener programs <b>netrx</b> or <b>udprx</b> as appropriate. The port is default 
16385, corresponding to the default of port 16385 for the commands. Any other available
port may be specified. </p>

<p>Normally, these messages are not of much interest to the running project, 
but when some trace-printing is needed, from the server in particular,
(on the client, the <a href="lcxh.html#message">message(&nbsp;)</a>
function goes a long way), this is very useful. Custom messages from LCX
code can be emitted using the 
<a href="lcxh.html#trace">trace(&nbsp;)</a>
function of LCX.</p>

<p>On the server, the debug-output can be restricted to only put out 
info from calls to <a href="lcxh.html#trace">trace(&nbsp;)</a>
and not from everything else that is going on in the server.  To control this,
the entry debuglevel= in <a href="serverini.html#options.debuglevel"> server.ini</a> 
can be set to debuglevel=LCX for only LCX-origin output, 
or the default debuglevel=DLL for everything. </p>

<p> It is also possible to turn debugging on or off while the WinPCS 
server or client program is running, by using one of the functions
<a href="lcxh.html#AimDebugOutput">AimDebugOutput(&nbsp;)</a> or
<a href="lcxh.html#CWULIB">CWULIB(&nbsp;)</a>. Once debugging is turned on, and
until it is turned off, all messages from the system will appear, whether these come from the 
compiled code in one or another of the DLL or SO files, or from 
<a href="lcxh.html#trace">trace(&nbsp;)</a> 
calls in LCX code. </p>

<a name="netrx"/>
<h2>netrx</h2>
<p>
This console program listens for messages on the port that some WinPCS server
or client may be emitting messages into using the TCP protocol.  When it 
has received a message, it puts it out on the screen.  <b>netrx</b> is a 
receive-only server, that never transmits anything back.  </p>

<p>To run this, open a command-line window, and run the command</p>
<pre><b>netrx -p </b><em>port</em></pre>
<p>to establish <b>netrx</b> listening on the numbered TCP port.
This has to be the same port as is specified in the 
debug= setting. Several instances listening on different 
ports, for example one for the server, and another for the client,  may be 
running at the same time.</p>

<p>There are versions of <b>netrx</b> available for Windows, Linux, BSD and hp-ux.
</p>

<a name="udprx"/>
<h2>udprx</h2>
<p>
This is the UDP equivalent of <b>netrx</b>. This is also a console program 
that sits listens for messages on the port that some WinPCS server
or client may be emitting messages into, using the UDP protocol.  
When it has received a message, it puts it out on the screen.  
<b>udprx</b>, like <b>netrx</b>, is receive-only. </p>

<p>To run this, open a command-line window, and run the command</p>
<pre><b>udprx -p </b><em>port</em></pre>
<p>to establish <b>udprx</b> listening on the numbered port.
This would generally be the same port as is specified in one of the 
debug= settings. Several instances listening on different 
ports may be running at the same time.</p>
<p>There are versions of <b>udprx</b> available for Windows, Linux, and BSD.
</p>

<h2>Capturing output to a file</h2>
<p>Both netrx and udprx can save the received text into a file. One of the command-line arguments</p>

<pre>-o <em>filename</em> </pre>

<p>or </p>

<pre>-d <em>prefix</em> </pre>

<p>will allow this to happen. This argument comes in addition to any <tt>-p <em>port</em></tt> 
arguments used to define the port number.  </p>

<p> the <tt>-d <em>prefix</em></tt> makes the output go into a file with the name <em>prefix<b>MMDDNN</b></em>,
where <em>MM</em> and <em>DD</em> are the month and day of the file's creation, and <em>NN</em> will be 
a sequence number starting at <b>01</b> for each of of several files created on the same day. </p>

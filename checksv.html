<h1>WinPCS Client Installation and Update program.</h1>

<p><b>CHECKSV.EXE</b> is a stand-alone executable file, which contains a subset of
WinPCS client elements, enough to allow it to pull the entire regular set 
of client side files from a master copy located on the server. </p>

<p><b>CHECKSV.EXE</b> is to be run on any remote client in a WAN, and allows 
the users there to get an updated WinPCS installation, or verify that 
the one he has is up to date, at any time this may be desired.  
The program requires only the <b>CHECKSV.EXE</b> and the <b>ZLIB1.DLL</b> files to 
run.  <b>ZLIB1.DLL</b> is the compression-library, which hardly ever has to be 
changed, and is used for transferring data between the WinPCS server and
clients. </p>

<p><b>CHECKSV.EXE</b> communicates with a running WinPCS server, and allows a comparison
of the master files on the server to be done against any operating files on 
the client. Any such files that are found to be different from the ones in 
the master set on the server, even if more recent; are deemed to have 
been changed and thus require an update.  All files in a number of folders are
handled through this mechanism. Subfolders are not handled automatically; if 
there are any, these will have to be considered folders in their own right 
and must be listed on the server, following their parent folders. </p>

<p>This allows the <b>CHECKSV.EXE</b> also to be used for the client installation 
process, as will be detailed in the following. </p>

<p>The <b>CHECKSV.EXE</b> also looks at an existing <b>ANCHORC.DLL</b> 
and makes sure this belongs to the same project as the server whose master 
files are to be read.
If this were not done, it would be possible to update a set of files for the
wrong project, with subsequent problems.  For this, the <b>CHECKSV.EXE</b> also needs
some version of <b>CWULIB.DLL</b> as the <b>ANCHORC.DLL</b> requires that to work. 
Unlike the <b>ZLIB1.DLL</b>, this <b>CWULIB.DLL</b> will be checked and if necessary, 
updated later. It is only needed for the <b>ANCHORC.DLL</b> not for <b>CHECKSV.EXE</b> 
itself.</p>

<h1>Server-side preparations</h1>
<p>For <b>CHECKSV.EXE</b> to work properly, the master folders and files must be
located on the server.  These should be in a format and location
that allows a client to be run on that machine, for testing and debugging. </p>

<h2>Master folders on the server</h2>

<p>The folders to be copied to the client-side machine includes as a 
minimum, the <b>SYSTEM32</b>, <b>INI</b>, and <b>PROG_CLIENT</b> 
folders and the contents 
of these. More folders may be included in this set. 
A master copy of the contents of these folders should be located
on the server. Generally, this also allows us to run a client on this
machine, and in mixed LAN/WAN environments, we should be able to use this
set as both the working data for the LAN and the master copy for the WAN. </p>

<h2>Server-side settings, server.ini</h2>

<p>The 
<a href="serverini.html#section.20client">section [client] in server.ini</a>
specifies which these folders are. The
entry folders= here lists the various folders in numbered-drive format,
for example:</p>

<pre>
[client]
; Client-master files for updates
folders=9:\ini 9:\system32 9:\prog_client
</pre>

<p>Both the server and the client will have to know about their locations. 
Using the customary definition of the 9: drive as the parent of the 
0: directories for both the server and client will make this work. </p>

<h1>First-time installation</h1>
<p>The steps for initial client installation are, presuming the
important client directories are <b>SYSTEM32</b> and <b>PROG_CLIENT</b>. Other 
names will have to be substituted, but the logic and the files
are the same:</p>
<li>Create the <b>SYSTEM32</b> folder </li>
<li>copy the <b>ANCHORC.DLL</b> for the project into <b>SYSTEM32</b></li>
<li>Create the <b>PROG_CLIENT</b> folder </li>
<li>copy the <b>CHECKSV.EXE</b>, <b>ZLIB1.DLL</b>, and <b>CWULIB.DLL</b> 
	files into <b>PROG_CLIENT</b></li>
<li>Create shortcut for <b>CHECKSV.EXE</b>
<li>Run <b>CHECKSV.EXE</b>
<li>Tell it about the client directory and server name and port</li>
<li>Have it perform the installation of the rest of the system</li>
<li>Create shortcut for <b>WinPCS.EXE</b></li>
<li>Create or edit the shortcut for <b>CHECKSV.EXE</b> so that it 
later can be used for updating. Make sure that <b>CHECKSV.EXE</b> refers to
to the same server address as WinPCS.EXE does.</li>

<p>For an initial installation of the client, the directory which will 
eventually hold the executable files for the client should be created, 
and the two files <b>CHECKSV.EXE</b> and <b>ZLIB1.DLL</b> should be 
located in this directory. Then <b>CHECKSV.EXE</b> should be run without 
any arguments.  A shortcut for it may be created at this time, and 
this will later become edited into the shortcut for the Update Client process. </p>

<p>For the verification of the <b>ANCHORC.DLL</b> to be made for the 
project, this file must also exist in the ultimate client system 
directory, <b>SYSTEM32</b>. No other files need exist here 
initially; they will be copied from the server later. </p>

<p>All other folders that may be referenced will be created as 
necessary and then populated. To summarize, the following four files 
should exist at the beginning: </p>

<li>PROG_CLIENT/CHECKSV.EXE</li>
<li>PROG_CLIENT/ZLIB1.DLL</li>
<li>PROG_CLIENT/CWULIB.DLL</li>
<li>SYSTEM32/ANCHORC.DLL</li>

<p><b>CHECKSV.EXE</b> will present its main window, and the user 
will have to define the
settings manually. Later, these will be obtained from the files in the
<b>SYSTEM32</b> directory, but as these aren't here yet, we will have to enter
them manually, through the dialog from the menu System/Set Settings Manually. </p>

<p>This dialogbox has a number of edit-controls for these settings. </p>

<p>The <b>Client Directory</b> should be set to the directory where 
the <b>SYSTEM32</b>, <b>INI</b>, and <b>PROG_CLIENT</b> folders 
are located.  This indicates where to the folders are
to be created and filled. </p>

<p>The <b>Client User</b> may be left blank, as a suitable 
default name will be used. </p>

<p>The <b>Server Name or IP address</b> should be set to refer to the machine
where the WinPCS server program is running.  This can be the machine's
IP address or machine name as appropriate.</p>

<p>The <b>Server Endpoint</b> is the TCP port number that this WinPCS server is
using. This is usually set in the ANCHORS.DLL, or it may be redefined
by the endpoint= setting in SERVER.INI and WINPCS.INI. 
This will be the same port number as will later be used by the regular
WinPCS client.  Notice that this ANCHORS.DLL must refer to the same project
as the <b>ANCHORC.DLL</b> </p>

<p>The <b>Authentication</b> Checkbox indicates whether the RPC authentication
is used, corresponding to the auth= entries in SERVER.INI and WINPCS.INI. 
This must be in agreement with the setting on the WinPCS server. Systems 
using Windows XP SP2 must have this turned on, others may have it on or
off. Servers and clients must be in agreement of this setting. </p>

<p>Once these settings are given, the dialog may be dismissed with OK.
The current settings will now be shown in the main <b>CHECKSV.EXE</b> window. If
they don't look right, the settings dialog may be used again for 
changing them.  </p>

<p>Once the settings are done, the Perform Check command under the System 
menu can be issued. This will make <b>CHECKSV.EXE</b> go to the WinPCS server
identified in the Settings, and have it transmit all the files in all the 
folders that are indicated. Any files or folders not existing will be 
created in the process. There will be a flashing odometer indicating progress
of all the files, and a summary by folder will be shown on the main 
<b>CHECKSV.EXE</b> window.  <b>CHECKSV.EXE</b> may now be closed. </p>

<p>When all the files are pulled across, the shortcut for the WinPCS client
can be created. The executable file should be <b>WINPCS.EXE</b> 
under <b>PROG_CLIENT</b>, 
and the Working Directory should refer to the <b>SYSTEM32</b> folder. 
Also, make sure that the correct server address for WinPCS is used,
this is indicated by a parameter <b>-S 1</b>, <b>-S 2</b>, or similar,
referring to the server<i>n</i> entry in WinPCS.INI.
</p>

<p>The shortcut for <b>CHECKSV.EXE</b> should now be changed to 
use the <b>SYSTEM32</b> as the working directory.</p>

<p><b>CHECKSV.EXE</b> should now be able to figure out the client settings
by itself. To test this, start it and run the menu entry 
System/Detect settings, and then review the settings displayed. 
When correctly configured, <b>CHECKSV.EXE</b> will display the same 
system directory, server name, and TCP port as WinPCS itself uses.</p>

<p>Attempting the System/Perform Check will make it check the files
and find that they are all the same, and do no updates. This is fine. </p>

<p>Once the manual actions are tested and found to work OK, the 
update process can be automated by editing the <b>CHECKSV.EXE</b> shortcut 
and have it include the <b>-A</b> argument after the executable file name. </p>

<!-- Possible improvements: 
	-Let <b>CHECKSV.EXE</b> use its parent directory as initially suggested
		setting for the Client Dir. 
	-Allow <b>CHECKSV.EXE</b> to create shortcuts 
		for itself and WINPCS.EXE with proper paths and parameters. 
	-Allow <b>CHECKSV.EXE</b> to search for and
		find any ..\SYSTEM32\ANCHORC.DLL file and use that 
--> 

<h1>Subsequent updates</h1>
<p>To perform a subsequent update with minimal user interaction, the shortcut
for <b>CHECKSV.EXE</b> should be set up to use the <b>-A</b> argument 
(ie. <b>X:\winpcs\prog_client\CHECKSV.EXE -A</b>)
and have its working directory be <b>SYSTEM32</b>, very similar to 
the requirements for the WinPCS client itself. It must use the <b>-S</b> 
argument to refer to the correct server address. This is the same as the 
WinPCS client will use.  </p>

<p>Running this shortcut now will cause it to look
at the server and update any necessary files, without further interaction. 
It stops at the end, with a message-box indicating the completion, and 
the main window will show the summaries by folder.  Closing the message box
will cause <b>CHECKSV.EXE</b> to stop, and now the WinPCS client is ready to run. </p>

<p>Note that the WinPCS Client should not be running on the machine 
while <b>CHECKSV.EXE</b> is running there, or <b>CHECKSV.EXE</b> may fail to 
update any executable files that have changed.  Should this happen, just 
stopping the WinPCS Client and re-running <b>CHECKSV.EXE</b> will be 
sufficient to make sure all the program files will be properly updated.</p>

<p>Otherwise, <b>CHECKSV.EXE</b> can be run at any time. </p>

<h1>Command-line and menu reference</h1>

<p><b>CHECKSV.EXE</b> runs as a GUI Windows application. It can take three command-line
arguments: <b>-A</b>, <b>-D </b><i>ipaddress</i><b>:</b><i>port</i>, and
<b>-S </b><i>index</i>.</p> 

<p><b>-A</b> means it should run an update pass automatially.  This is most useful on
an existing installed client, where there is a known <b>ANCHORC.DLL</b> from where
all the necessary parameters can be found. </p>

<p><b>-D </b><i>ipaddress</i><b>:</b><i>port</i> is used for debugging. 
in a matter analogous to the Debug=net entries in WinPCS.INI or SERVER.INI.
It allows trace-printing across the network to some machine running a netrx
listener on a port. The <i>ipaddress</i> is the IP-address of this machine, and 
the <i>port</i> is the TCP port on which a netrx process is listening there. </p>

<p><b>-S </b><i>index</i> indicates to CHECKSV.EXE that the server address of 
that number, as specified in WinPCS.INI, is to be used. On projects where some
clients are on a LAN and others are on a WAN, this is how the different
addresses can be handled without maintaining different files. Both WinPCS and
CHECKSV.EXE use this mechanism to address the server.  </p>

<p>The menu has two dropdowns, <i>System</i> and <i>Help. </i>
Most actions appear under <i>System</i>. <i>System/Exit</i> and <i>Help/About</i> ought to
be self-explanatory. </p>

<p><i>System/Detect Settings</i> will cause <b>CHECKSV.EXE</b> to attempt finding the settings
from the information in the client's <b>ANCHORC.DLL</b> and WINPCS.INI. If it cannot
find anything it will complain about <b>ANCHORC.DLL</b> or <b>CWULIB.DLL</b> or some such
file missing.</p>

<p><i>System/Set Settings Manually</i> allows us to edit the settings of <b>CHECKSV.EXE</b></p>

<p><i>System/Test Server access</i> allows us to test that <b>CHECKSV.EXE</b> can talk to the server.
This will cause it to try to connect, then obtain the version string from the server, and if 
this is OK, display that string.</p> 

<p><i>System/Test File Update</i> allows us to check how <b>CHECKSV.EXE</b> would go about updating files. 
The program would go through the motions of checking and updating files, but not actually copy them across. </p>

<p><i>System/Perform Check</i> causes <b>CHECKSV.EXE</b> to actually go ask the server for
changes and update any files that have been found to have changed. </p>

<h1>Control and Fields Functions -- Category 7</h1> <p> 

<h3>Enabling control in WinPCS:</h3>
<p>1. Any 
CONTROL=file function
entry in the [target] section of a TRANS, FORKS (16-bit only), or standard Import script file. (X FX or 
XD file)</p>

<p>
2. Any 
tgtfield=function
or
tgtfield=$__tgtfield
entries in the [TRANSFER] section of a TRANS, (.X) file, the [connection] section of a 
FORKS (.fx) file or a [xx-TRANSFER] section of a Standard Imports ( XD) file.</p>

<h3>LCX files for TRANS, FORKS and Standard Imports:</h3>
The pathname may be given in the first word in the CONTROL=file function entry in the 
[target] section of  a control file. If this is set to a single dash ( - ), the LCX code is taken 
from the [LCX] section in the control file itself. 
For INSPECT and SYNFARE, the file and function are selected as part of the formula 
dialog.:

<p>Here, the function takes no arguments, and the return value is used to determine 
whether a subsequent update is to take place, by selecting this in the dialog.

<h3>Description of CONTROL functions:</h3>
The CONTROL macro function is bound to the Target end of a transfer or import, or the 
connection end of the FORKS 
It is selected via the entry
CONTROL=file function 
in the control  file. There is one invocation per record in the transfer, import, or 
connection, and the execution context lasts from the first one to the last one.

<h3>Description of Field Transfer functions:</h3>
The field-transfer function is bound to a field. The name of the function is two 
underscores followed by the name of the target field. The target field is linked to the 
function using the 
tgtfield=$__tgtfield
notation. If the function is specified as
tgtfield=function
in the .X file, this will be converted to
tgtfield = $__tgtfield

[LCX]
__tgtfield( )
{
    return(function( ));
}

before the .X file is run.

<h3>Disallowed functions:</h3>
DDE callback and document-drawing functions are only available inside the DDE 
callback and Printing callback  environments.  Though there is no restrictions on 
initiating printing or DDE-operations, this does not seem to make much sense for 
typically off-line jobs like TRANS, FORKS, or Imports do; or the one-time nature of the 
Formula functions. For the same reason, the message( ), input( ), yesno( ) or question( ) 
functions, although legal, are not very useful

<h3>Special functions:</h3>
<b>InValue(field )</b><br>
This returns the value of the specified field in the current record of the input. The input 
may be a SYNFARE view or a TRANS or FORKS source file, as defined within them.

<p><b>OutValue(field, value) </b><br>
This places the selected value to a specified field in the output. For TRANS only, 
the TargetPut(field, value) is equivalent.

<p>TRANS additionally provides a target-side read-back function, 

<p><b>TargetGet(field)</b><br>
which returns the latest stored value of specified field in the target record.

<h3>Callback functions:</h3>
The CONTROL function is called right before the insertion into the target register takes 
place, after the transfer formulas are evaluated,  and after lexical checks are passed. 

<p>It is called with 4 arguments:

<p>control(fromtype, fromname, totype, toname)

<p>Its purpose is to selectively accept and reject records, and to modify the ones that can 
be determined are partially OK or partially complete. 

<p>The function can access any system databases via the usual means (put, get, findexact 
and so on). This allows it to be used for validating equipment types, areas, and so forth, 
which are not handled either by the immediate formulas or the lexical patterns.

<h3>Return Value:</h3>
The return value for the controll function is expected to be a one- or a two-part set 
consisting of a numeric value and an optional information string for the .log file, which 
may or  may not be required according to the following  information.  (Odd-numbered 
codes require and put  out log-text, even ones do not).

<p>The number is to be set in the function as follows:
<br>-4 or STOP  -- Terminate the transfer operation immediately, with no information to 
the log file. 
<br>-3 or STOPINFO -- Terminate the transfer operation immediately, with information to the 
log file. 
<br>-2 or SKIP -- Skip this record without any log-information.  
<br>-1 or SKIPINFO -- Skip this record, but log information.  Do not insert or update. 
<br>0 or USE -- Normal operation, insert or update as desired given the data as it is when 
this function returns.  Do not put any message into the log file.
<br>1 or USEINFO -- Normal operation, as above, but with the given text appended to the log 
file. 
<br>2 or INSONLY -- insert, but refrain from updating if a duplicate key value error occurs 
upon insertion. Log this condition to the error and log files instead.  Do not  put any 
additional messages (from the text) into the log file. 
<br>3 or INSONLYINFO -- Insert, do not update as for code 2, but do also put stuff into the 
log file.  
<p>The identifiers STOP, STOPINFO and so on are defined as global variables in the 
execution environment in TRANS.
Other values then these shown are reserved for future expansions. Until further notice 
they should not  be attempted used.

<p>For Field-functions, the return value is the value that the field is to have.

<h3>Execution context:</h3>
Shared between the fields. A Global variable set up in one field is available in 
subsequent fields. Re-entered for every record.

<h1>Guide to WinPCS documentation</h1>

<p>The documentation for the "32-bit WinPCS" as it has become known,
is for a large part in the various HTML files here.  Much of this
is the equivalent of the old "16-bit WinPCS" System Manual.  The 
number of bits in the program files is really only the smallest
difference. The more accurate descriptions would be the
"Client-Server" version and the "Monolithic" version. </p>

<h2>About the monolithic, "16-bit" WinPCS</h2>
<p>The "16-bit WinPCS" is the old, well-known, monolithic version. 
It used the Btrieve Database engine and the server for file-serving, 
and had all its executable files in one place, replicated directly 
or via the file server, on all the workstations. The system consisted of
4 major parts: 
<br/>1. Data, usually in the DATA directory. 
<br/>2. Executable files ("the DLLs") in a PROG directory 
<br/>3. Configuration files, typically in the SYSTEM and INI directories
<br/>4. Proforma documents for check-sheets and certificates, in subdirectories under FORMS, and in SYSTEM. </p>

<p>The configuration files were text files, either in INI format or 
LCX-files containing macrofunctions. Some of the files, 
such as the ones for Standard Imports were hybrids. A few data tables also
contained configuration information.</p>

<h2>About the Client-Server, "32-bit" WinPCS</h2>
<p>The realities of projects where there usually would be several sites
geographically separated, but with Internet connectivity; dictated that
WinPCS needed to be able to run at decent speed not just on high-bandwidth
LANs, but also where the network had less bandwidth available. Some yards
alone were big enough that the monilitic version ran slow and was 
unpleasant to use. And forget about any of the projects where the sites
were far apart geographically. For some time, remote desktop solutions, 
such as Windows Terminal Server or Citrix would do, but the time came
in 2004 when the first real client-server installation was deployed. 
This happened at the HHI yard in Ulsan, South Korea. </p>

<p>The prime design criterion of this newer version was that the network
load and bandwidth requirements were to be at a minimum. This made it 
natural to split some of the jobs between the server side and the client
side. Jobs like status index reports, that required lots of lookups in tables
were relegated to the server, and they would only emit the found records that
are to make it into the report view.  Similarly, once the report is run, the
summary reports are done on the client, since this is a matter from the report
view only and does not involve the server.  Similar considerations have been
done with other standard activities, such as filling in bookmark fields in 
Word forms, or making calls to the "make" or "break" functions for connections.</p>

<p>To this end, a lot of reference and static data from the server gets cached 
in the client during use, so there is no further need for hitting on the server
for this. Such caching includes STADLG.INI, check-sheet tables such as REFITR1,
excerpts as needed from REFREP, discipline codes, and other things like that. </p>

<p>As to the main components, the client-server system consists of 5 parts:
<br/>1. Server executables, in the PROG_SERVER or sometimes the SERVER directory
<br/>2. Server configuration files, in the SERVER directory
<br/>3. Data, in the DATA directory, considered to belong to the server.
<br/>4. Client executables, in the PROG_CLIENT directory
<br/>5. Client configuration files, in the SYSTEM32 and INI directories.
<br/>6. Proformas for check-sheets and certificates, usually in various 
subdirectories under FORMS and in SYSTEM32.</p>

<p>A comparison to the 16-bit system shows a lot of similarities.  What used to be one
program is now split into two, and some parts, such as data and a number of configuration
files have gone to the server side, the other parts have gone to the client parts. Of the
above, Nos. 1--3 are server, and 4--6 are client. </p>

<h2>Some highlights of current configurations</h2>
<p>Though the reader may be familiar with the 16-bit system, and the key configuration files
such as STATREES.INI, their new location and in some cases, slightly modified contents require
explanation. </p>

<h2>Side-by-side comparison of features in the monolithic "16-bit" and client-server "32-bit" systems</h2>

<p>The majority of the features and functions of the 16-bit systems have been ported, and
a few new ones have been added. In some cases, less useful things were postponed, and may yet
be re-instated. Others have been discarded. The following table lists the two sets of subsystems,
tables, functions etc. side by side, and indicates the differences.</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="2">
<tbody>

<tr>
<td>Client-Server 32-bit</td><td>Monolithic 16-bit</td> <td>Differences</td></tr>

<tr><td>RCONN (table)</td><td>RCONN (table)</td><td>Concept and purpose of the table is the same. 
	The layout is slightly different. See
	<a href="call3204.html">32-bit Make and Break functions</a>, and 
	<a href="call1604.html">16-bit Make and Break functions</a>.
	</td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="cxdict.html">CXDICT (table)</a></td><td><a href="cxdict.html">CXDICT (table)</a></td>
<td>Concept and purpose of the table is the same. 
	The table is even more important in the 32-bit systems. Missing entries will cause error notices 
	to appear. These are not fatal, merely annoying since their errors really should be fixed.
	CXDICT is cached on the server, and can be re-cached through the [Reload CXDICT] command
	from the Server dialog in the client.  CXDICT also have parts being used cached on the client, 
	so in general, expect to have to re-start the client for changes to take effect. 
</td> </tr>

<tr><td> <a href="ddmatrix.html"> DDMATRIX (table)</a></td><td>DDMATRIX (table)</td><td>
The concept of this is the same as before. Note that the function signatures have changed quite 
a lot, to a more regular form, that is well-documented and stable (the 16-bit ones were not). 
The callback functions run on the client, and are similar in scope and implementation to the 
16-bit ones. See <a href="call0005.html"> Drag and Drop actions -- Category 5</a>.
</td> </tr>

<tr><td> 
<a href="serverini.html">SERVER.INI</a> (server) <br/>
<a href="winpcsini.html">WINPCS.INI</a> (client) 
</td> <td> WINPCS.INI </td> <td> 
The main and miscellaneous configuration files are defined for each of the programs.
See the links for the details on the contents of the files.
</td> </tr>

<tr><td> <a href="serverini.html">SERVER.INI</a> (server) <br/> CLIENT.INI (client) </td> <td> BTRS.INI </td> <td> 
Client-side paths were defined in BTRS.INI on the 16-bit systems and are in CLIENT.INI on the 32-bit clients.
There is a similar section defined in SERVER.INI for the server. The idea of numbered paths remains useful and
used.
</td> </tr>

<tr><td> REFBMP31.INI <br/> *.BMP (client) </td> <td> REFBMP.INI / REFBMP.DLL </td> <td> 
Bitmaps are not stored in a DLL in the 32-bit system, but as "boards" in several BMP files found
in the SYSTEM32 directory. The server doesn't care about bitmaps at all. Bitmaps are cached as needed
on the client. They can be edited using MS-Paint or any other bitmap-aware program. The entries in 
REFBMP.INI have the same meaning: the name of a icon as used in WinPCS, then the board name or BMP file
name minus the .BMP extension, then the starting coordinates then the width and finally the height.
</td> </tr>

<tr><td> STADLG.INI (server) </td> <td> STADLG.INI </td> <td> Same purpose and concept. The 32-bit systems
	have the same get= and set= functions, but no add= functions. See 
<a href="call0001.html">Get and Set status</a> and 
<a href="call0003.html">Info Init</a>. 
The 32-bit systems have added mulitiline edit-controls using the keyword <b>big:</b>.
This file is cached on the server, and must be reloaded after changes, by either restarting the server
or using the [Reload STADLG] command from the Server dialog in the client. 
The various Get and Set functions run on the client, many of them are in the file UNISTAT.LCX.
</td> </tr>

<tr><td> STATREES.INI (server) </td> <td> STATREES.INI </td> <td> Same purpose and concept in both systems. 
There are settings in SERVER.INI indicating if the report layouts are in STAREP.INI or STATREES.INI. 
Most recent installations have them separated. 
This file is cached on the server, and must be reloaded after changes, by either restarting the server
or using the [Reload STATREES] command from the Server dialog in the client. 
</td> </tr>

<tr><td> STAREP.INI (server) </td> <td> STAREP.INI </td> <td> Same purpose and concept. There are settings
in SERVER.INI indicating if the report layouts are in STAREP.INI or STATREES.INI. Most recent installations
have them separated. The file is not cached, but read during running of status index reports. 
<a href="call3209.html">The functions on the fields </a> are run on the server. but functions 
referred to for pushbutton actions are run on the client.
</td> </tr>

<tr><td> REFREP (table) / REFREP.LCX (client) </td> <td> REFREP (table) / REFREP.LCX </td> 
<td> Same purpose and concept. 32-bit clients cache parts of REFREP the table as needed, so to re-read, a client
must be stopped and re-started.  The LCX file handles actions from DDMATRIX
</td> </tr>

<tr><td> PCSD.INI (client) </td> <td> PCSD.INI </td> <td> 
The main menu file on the client remains the same. There are a few enhancements, such as optional icons
in the menu entries, and the tables handled by View and Entries are specified directly, so the client doesn't
have to visit all the View INI files.
</td> </tr>

<tr><td> 
<a href="evini.html"> VIEW.INI </a>(client) </td> <td> (none) </td> <td> 
The VIEW.INI file defines default pushbuttons for all View, Entry, Inspect, and Report windows. These are 
specified in the familiar way, as documented in the link, but do not have to be repeated across all the
individual .INI files anymore.
</td> </tr>

<tr><td>
<a href="evini.html"> V*.INI E*.INI </a>(client) </td> <td> V*.INI E*.INI </td> <td> 
The individual View and Ini files contain specs for fields as before. There are some changes
in the possible secondary fields, these are documented in the link. The main parts
are still the same. Note that all fields that should be read-only in Entry windows, and
are not the result of some other expression, now must be marked with the $Keep(1) command.
This was not as strictly needed before
</td> </tr>

<tr><td> WinPCS Tools (WPTBOX) </td> <td> WBMGR </td> <td> 
This toolbox contains the command buttons for manipulating tables and verifying layouts of RCONN and other tables.
</td> </tr>

<tr><td> Server Tools </td> <td> (none) </td> <td> 
This allows several server-side actions to be done from the client. It also includes a viewer for cached items
in the client, moving files up and down to and from the server, reloading of key tables. The selection of command
buttons here and in the Toolbox will grow as we come up with new features.
</td> </tr>

<tr><td> (none) </td> <td> TOOLBAR </td> <td> 
The floating toolbar is gone. Its actions are now straight on the System Menu, several of which are under their
traditional names, notably Inspect, TRANS, and SYNFARE. 
</td> </tr>

<tr><td> (none) </td> <td> FORKS </td> <td> 
The FORKS has not been re-implemented. It has been superseded for the most part by Standard Imports, Gang Connect
and Gang Disconnect variations. 
</td> </tr>

<tr><td> (none) </td> <td> CCONN </td> <td> 
The CCONN lists assiociated with the View Connections windows were seen as unnecessary, since Hierarchies and
other VCONN lists and Views are plentiful and readily available.
</td> </tr>

<tr><td> One-column Gang Connect </td> <td> One-column Gang Connect </td> <td> 
This remains much the same. The file GCONN.INI allows a set of pushbuttons for common choices to appear
in the dialog, but anything else may be dragged in.
</td> </tr>

<tr><td> Two-column Gang Connect </td> <td> (none) </td> <td> 
This allows a connection to be made from values in two columns in SYNFARE or Report views. 
One column may be a tag number, another may be a check-sheet or subsystem or other tag. 
There is a mechanism to choose tables from CORE or the rest of the system to find the home tables for these tags.
</td> </tr>

<tr><td> Gang Disconnect </td> <td> (none) </td> <td> 
This allows a connection to be broken based on values in two columns in SYNFARE or Report views. 
Rather similar to Gang Connect, but disconnects instead.
</td> </tr>

<tr><td> INSPECT </td> <td> INSPECT </td> <td> 
This is nearly identical. Fields that are overlaid keys can be written to for searching, but values written here
will not be stored on insertions and updates. 
</td> </tr>

<tr><td> TRANS </td> <td> TRANS </td> <td> 
TRANS has a very different GUI. This is a non-modal dialog, that allows selection of the target and source
data sets and their fields and linkages between them. The dialog may be pushed aside, and other windows in WinPCS
may be consulted to examine the data.
</td> </tr>

<tr><td> SYNFARE </td> <td> SYNFARE </td> <td> 
SYNFARE and Report windows are now the same code for the most part. SYNFARE has a few more tools available, 
such as "run a macrofunction for each record"
</td> </tr>

<tr><td> (none) </td> <td> LISTVIEW </td> <td> 
The List-view mode of the regular Views and Inspect windows is not yet re-implemented. There has been some 
demand for it, so this may re-appear sometime. 
</td> </tr>

<tr><td> <a href="lcxh.html#SIRepGet">SIRepGet( )</a> <a href="lcxh.html#SIRepPut">SIRepPut( )</a> </td> <td> 
<a href="lcxh.html#RepGet">RepGet( )</a><br/> <a href="lcxh.html#RepPut">RepPut( )</a> </td> <td> 
Functions in status index reports that look at neighboring fields with <b>RepGet( )</b> and changed 
them with <b>RepPut( )</b> in the 16-bit systems must use 
the <b>SIRepGet( )</b> and <b>SIRepPut( )</b> functions instead, for this purpose.
</td> </tr>

<tr><td> <a href="lcxh.html#selectdialog">selectdialog( )</a> </td> <td> 
<a href="lcxh.html#selectdialogb">selectdialogb( )</a> </td> <td> 
The function <b>selectdialogb( )</b> in the 16-bit systems is replaced by the 32-bit <b>selectdialog( )</b> function, 
which also cover the special cases of the old <b>selectdialogb( )</b>. 
</td> </tr>

<h2>Caching, what, when, where, and why</h2>
<p>A number of data-elements are cached on use. The main reason is to save 
on processor and IO on the server and
save network traffic between the server and the client.  The effect of this seen
from the user's point of view is that changes do not take effect immediately,
but require some object or another to be re-loaded. </p>

<p>The following table lists the objects that can be cached, where this happens, 
and how to refresh them.  </p>

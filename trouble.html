<h1>Troubleshooting Guide</h1>

<p>Some problems with starting and running WinPCS are quite common. 
The communication between two application over a network can fail for
a lot of reasons, and the operating systems and database-systems 
can also add their share of possible
faults. Here are some of the most common things that can be wrong.</p>

<hr/>
<h2>Some or all users are unable to save AUTOCODE report layouts.</h2>

<h3>Symptom:</h3>
<p>The user is able to run a status index report, 
but when wanting to make changes to the layout, the changes will not stick
and be stored in AUTOCODE when using the save button in the editing window.</p>

<h3>Reason and resolution:</h3>
<p>There is an entry in USYM that controls this, it is EAUTOCODE. The table
shoul also ideally be defined in CXDICT with ITEMFIELD being LCXFUNCTION,
ITEMUNIFLD is RSERIAL and ITEMDESFLDS being DESCRIPTION. BASEDESCR should be
something like "Formatting Function".</p>
<p>Make sure that the user has the A permission set for the EAUTOCODE entry
when wanting to save these reports. It has been observed in some systems that
the MATRIX field in WUSER is not been fully filled with A or H letters, 
but has a long sequence of spaces at the end. When looking in the list for
Define User, these positions appear as H - Hidden, unavailable.</p>

<hr/>
<h2>Server `NO-SERVER` endpoint `5166` connection error 10049. <br/>
The requested address is not valid in this context.</h2>
<h3>Symptom:</h3>
<p>The server starts normally, but when attempting to run the client,
an error message with this text appears. The port number is most often 
5166, though other values such as 443 are possible. Stopping the server
or moving it to the port indicated makes no difference: the client is not
actually locating the server at all, as the message says, it cannot get
anything happening with the "NO-SERVER". Making changes to entries in 
winpcs.ini does not seem to work either; turning debugging on with a debug=
entry in section [WinPCS] for example, in an attempt to figure out this 
is futile.</p>

<p>The command-line debug statement, -N "udp host:port" for example, 
does turn the debugging on, and shows the client stopping at first attempt
to contact the server. </p>

<h3>Reason and resolution:</h3>
<p>The client is failing to read the WINPCS.INI file. This could of course
be because that file is missing, or it could be that there is an ANCHORC.DLL,
located in the wrong directory, such as PROG_CLIENT. There should be only
one ANCHORC.DLL file, and this one should be in the system directory, usually
this directory is called system32. </p>

<p>If there is an ANCHORC.DLL in PROG_CLIENT, all the files normally sitting
in system32 are expected to be found there instead; the ANCHORC.DLL has 
"anchored" the position of the client in the file system, but in the wrong
place. </p>

<p>Locating, then removing or at least renaming any stray ANCHORC.DLL files
will fix this.</p>

<hr></hr>
<h2>"Could not access the ANCHORC.DLL"</h2>
<h3>Symptom:</h3>
<p>On starting the client, there pops up a message-box with 
the title WinPCS and the text "Could not access the ANCHORC.DLL".</p>

<h3>Reason and resolution:</h3>
<p>As the message indicates, the file ANCHORC.DLL, which is used
to position WinPCS within the file-systems, could not be
accessed and loaded successfully.</p>

<p>The ANCHORC.DLL file for the project should be in the system32 
directory, and the shortcut from the client should point to this 
directory as its current directory, as shown in this image:</p>

<p><img border=0 src="shortcut.jpeg" width="367" height="504"/></p>

<!-- , or the path in the go.ini 
file should point here, if the go.exe starter is used.  -->

<!--
<p>To verify the integrity of the ANCHORC.DLL open a command-shell, and run
the showbld utility on the anchorc.dll file. It should reply with a string
similar to this from the HHI Kizomba B project:</p>
<pre>
ANCHORC.DLL: ANCHORC.DLL 4.5.KIZOMBAB 5700 HHI Kizomba B EPC-2
</pre>
<p>though obviously with whatever project name and installation number 
that applies to the installation at hand</p>
-->

<h2>Connection error 1722</h2>
<p>This indicates that the server is not found by the client at all, 
that the client cannot see the server through the network.</p>

<h3>Symptoms:</h3>
<p>On starting the client, a message-box with the title "WinPCS startup Failed" 
saying something like "Server Demo endpoint `5166` connection error 1722".  
The name "Demo" would be the name of the server machine that the client is 
looking for; this can also be shown as an IP address. An Endpoint, which may be 
a TCP port number different from the example 5166, may also be included in 
the message.  </p>

<h3>Reason and resolution:</h3>
<p>There can be a number of reasons for this:<p>
<li>The server may not be running at all. </p>

<p>Check this one first. If the server is
running as a service, check if it is still running, or stop the service and
let the server run in a command-window just to be sure its absence is not a problem.
Once the client works, re-try it with the server as a service. </P>

<p>Before the client and server have been found to connect, leave 
the server running in its command-window, this contains some important 
information that will be valuable in the following.  </p></li>

<li>The server may be using a different endpoint (TCP port) than what the client expects.
<p>Make sure that the settings in the server.ini and the winpcs.ini agree on 
their endpoint setting. This entry should either be absent in both files, 
when the server and client uses the settings in their ANCHORS.DLL/ANCHORC.DLL
files; or they should agree on the port number, which usually is somewhere
in the range 14100-14135. On startup, the server announces this port number
in its command-window, at the end where it says: 
"The WinPCS-Server is listening on 14100..." or whatever other port number 
it is using. If this port number does not look right, check the 
endpoint= setting in the server.ini file.  To make any changes in server.ini
take effect, the server must be stopped and restarted.</p>
</li>

<li>The client may be looking for the server program on the wrong machine.

<p>Make sure the server's name or IP address is specified correctly in the 
server= entry in the client's WinPCS.INI file.  On WAN installations, there
may be different names or IP-addresses from within or outside of the 
installation; the variant specs server1= server2= etc can be used to 
indicate this in the winpcs.ini files, having the clients using the server1=
start with the command-line argument "-S 1", the clients using the server2=
name start with the command-line argument "-S 2", and so on. Servers misidentified
like this may often show in the message box as the server name "No-server".
</p> 

<p>On startup, the WinPCS server program announces the hostname of the
machine it is running on, Look for the first line after the initial 
announcements of load addresses of DLLs, their names and versions, 
that reads something like:</p>
<pre>
W31SVR W31svr.c(95): hostname = KRL2137
</pre>
<p>The name after the "hostname =" is the server machine's hostname which is
what the client should be looking for in its server= entry in winpcs.ini. 
</p>
</li>

<li>The network between them may not allow traffic through on 
the specified port. 
<p>This may happen on a WAN if there are firewalls
between the two, and traffic on the TCP port that WinPCS uses 
is not let through.  First, to eliminate other reasons, make sure 
that the server and client can communicate on a LAN so that the server is
running and that they are in agreement about the port numbers and other 
settings.  It may also be useful to first try ping to see if the network
appears connected at all. Note that ping uses ICMP packages, not TCP, so 
even if ping makes it through, that still doesn't mean TCP will necessarily
work.  To check the TCP port, something like nmap can tell if a 
server is visible and listening, but before doing this, check that 
the firewalls and proxies are open for this port.
</p> </li>

<h2>Connection error 5</h2>
<p>This indicates that the client was denied access to the server.  </p>

<h3>Symptoms:</h3>
<p>The client program starts with a message box with the title 
"WinPCS startup Failed" saying "Server Demo endpoint `5166` connection error 5". 

<h3>Reason and resolution:</h3>
<p>The server would not let the client connect, because of a total 
authentication failure. This may be because the authentication is turned
off on the client but be set as required by the server or the 
operating system. </p>

<p>Check that the settings for auth= in server.ini and winpcs.ini are the
same, and that auth=on in both files if either the server or the client,
or both, are running on Windows XP SP 2, where authentication is required
by the operating system. On other Windows versions, the authentication may
be either on or off, but the server and the client should agree. </p>

<hr></hr>
<h2>Connection error 1747</h2>
<p>This indicates that the client could not authenticate to gain access 
to the server. </p>

<h3>Symptoms:</h3>
<p>The client program starts with a message box with the title 
"WinPCS startup Failed" saying "Server Demo endpoint `5166` connection error 1747". </p>

<h3>Reason and resolution:</h3>
<p>This happens if the client has authentication turned on and the server has
it turned off. The system cannot reconcile the authentication method
that the client is announcing, with what the server is using. The fix is easy:
make sure that auth= in both the server.ini and the winpcs.ini agree, either on or off, 
and if either of the client or server is running Windows XP SP2, make sure
it is auth=on everywhere. </p>




<hr></hr>
<h2>Connection error 1717</h2>
<p>This indicates that the client code is incompatible with the server. </p>

<h3>Symptoms:</h3>
<p>The client program starts with a message box with the title 
"WinPCS startup Failed" saying "Server Demo endpoint `5166` connection error 1717". </p>

<h3>Reason:</h3>
<p>This happens when the client-side RPC files are incompatible with the server-side
RPC files. This can happen when these two sets of files are from different compilations,
and they are sufficiently different so that they no longer "talk the same language". </p>

<h3>Resolution:</h3>
<p>Make sure that both the server and the client run files created on the same date. We always
publish matched pairs of server and client executables ("DLLs") with the same date stamp, 
as zip files, with the prefix SV for server and CL for client, and the next six digits identifying 
the year, month, and day. </p>

<p>For example, SV060821.ZIP and CL060821.ZIP would be such a pair created on August 21 2006.</p>

<p>See <a href="http://winpcs.com/updates">http://winpcs.com/updates</a> for the most
recent of these files.  </p>

<hr></hr>
<h2>Connection error 1727</h2>
<p>This indicates that the client could connect and authenticate, but that finding
or calling the actual function on the server failed. </p>

<h3>Symptoms:</h3>
<p>CHECKSV can report this when testing server connectivity, or The WinPCS client program 
starts with the usual splash-screen and, if that is being used, 
the login dialog where the user logs in; then the program stops with 
a message box with the title "WinPCS startup Failed" because of "Server 
Demo connection error 1727". </p>

<h3>Reason and resolution:</h3>
<p>There are several possible reasons for this. 
This could happen because the editions of the clients CHECKSV.EXE or NEXUS31.DLL and the server W31SVR.EXE 
are mismatched; in that the RPC functions in them do not line up properly. This could also happen
when running clients and servers of different ages. Check the version strings of the two
executable components. If these have different build numbers, that means they were not 
compiled together, and may not necessarily work together. Sometimes, RPC functions have
to be added or modified, and this can cause various incompatibilites between servers and clients
of different vintages. However, if their build numbers are the same, they should also work
together. </p>

<p>If  the error occurs on connections (as evidenced by debugging-statements from CHECKSV.EXE), 
the problem might also be with firewalling of the server site, and certain versions and service-pack levels
of the Windows 2003 server and Windows XP workstations. Evidently, certain recent service packs have changed their
protocol for authentication, and this may have become blocked by firewalls. There may also be other firewall 
settings that block the secondary, reverse, connections that the RPC system on the Windows machine running 
the WinPCS client, makes in the port range anywhere from about 1050 and upwards, and which it needs for doing
its work. </p>

<p>In particular, if the regular nmap TCP connect command:<br/>
nmap -sT -p port server<br/>
indicates the port on the server open and available, but the status 1727 error still occurs, this could be
the case.</p>

<hr></hr>
<h2>Server startup error: failed to find a path for CXDICT.</h2>
<p>This indicates that the WinPCS server could not talk with the
Pervasive database, and have it tell where the CXDICT data file is
located.</p>

<h3>Symptoms:</h3>
<p>The server startup screen, if run from the command-line, reports that 
there were errors encountered on startup, and the lines showing errors
read something like this: </p>

<pre>
TMGT check.c(60): Start-Check: Table CXDICT file  ... Error
TMGT open.c(121): Open3: Table CXDICT file  Btrieve Open = 11
TMGT check.c(71): Start-Check: Table CXDICT Open state = 1 ... Error
</pre>

<p>There should normally appear path names after the word "file" in 
the first two lines. The status value <b>11</b> for Btrieve Open
in the second line indicates a bad filename as well. </p>

<p>Other values commonly seen are <b>94</b> meaning Btrieve did not start,
<b>161</b> meaning the user-licenses are not correct, and <b>3012</b> when
the Workgroup Engine is not running.</p>

<h3>Reason and resolution:</h3>
<p>This indicates that the WinPCS server is not able to get the correct data
out of the Pervasive (Btrieve) engine. Make sure Pervasive is running and
functioning well, and that the WinPCS server program runs on the sam machine
as the Pervasive engine. (sometimes, remote access and the like may make this
a little unclear)</p>

<hr/>
<h2>Writing to data files give "error 46"</h2>

<p>This indicates that although the WinPCS client and server 
server could talk to each other over the network, and read the table files,
WinPCS is not allowed to write to them. One common problem is that the
data files is in an older version that the Pervasive package no longer supports
writing to. Pervasive version 9 can read, but not write, version 5 files, which 
are the ones used in all the old 16-bit projects. </p>

<h3>Symptoms:</h3>
<p>Server and client start normally, reporting no errors, and everything actually 
works fine until some record in some table is to be inserted or updated. 
Then this fails with "error 46", indicating that this table is effectively read-only.  
This may only apply to some tables, where the ones that work has been stored in a 
file version that the working Pervasive version can write to. </p>

<h3>Reason and resolution:</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, there is a mismatch between the Pervasive version being used 
and the format of the files. For example, with Pervasive 9 being deployed on new projects, old files
from the 16-bit days, which are version 5, no longer can be updated; revealing this problem.  </p>

<p>There is a utility that comes with Pervasive, called "Rebuild", that can be used to upgrade
the format of the data files to more recent versions.  As all the old features are retained
in the newer versions, there is no real operational impact on WinPCS itself.  </p>

<hr/>
<h2>Status index reports show additional lines with <b>&lt;no&nbsp;leaf&gt;</b> for the leaf object.</h2>

<h3>Symptoms:</h3>
<p>Status indexes run normally and show all the objects expected, but the report is cluttered
with records where some fields say 
<b>&lt;no&nbsp;leaf&gt;</b> 
instead of the identifier. </p>

<h3>Reason and resolution:</h3>
<p>The information in STADLG.INI for this report does not contain a statement telling what to do with
unconnected items, the usual thing to do with these is to skip them; thus make sure there is an
entry reading</p>
<pre><b>unconn=4 SKIP</b></pre>
<p>in the relevant section in STADLG.INI.</p>
<p>The old default was to include these, with some co-operative programming, this can be used to
display summaries for higher-up objects in the report. Then again, the Qreports have been made to do
this easier.</p>

<h2> I/O Error, 25, when attempting to create a table file. </h2>
<h3>Symptoms:</h3>
<p>When doing the Create action from the Toolbox, the creation fails with the message: 
"DB Engine Status 25 Create I/O error".  The table will not have been created. </p>

<h3>Reason and resolution:</h3>
<p>This is caused by the table-file being locked by Btrieve, on behalf of some user. 
In general, when re-creating table files, there should only be one user on the system. 
The stop-flag mechanism is useful to ensure that other clients are out. Check which ones these
are in the System/Server/Info on connections list. </p>

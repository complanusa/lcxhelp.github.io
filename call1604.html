<h1>Make and Break -- Category 4 (16-bit WinPCS)</h1> <p> 

<h3>Enabling controls in WinPCS:</h3>
Function calls in this category are made when an item is connected to or disconnected 
from another item, and there is a reference to a function in <b>STADLG.INI</b>, in the <b>MAKE=</b>
or <b>BREAK=</b> entriy respectively,  in the dialog referred to in the </b>[$SINGLE]</b> 
section where the left side refers to the table of the item being dragged onto the View-Connections of 
the other.  Unfortunately, Gang Connections perform its work in the opposite direction, 
and these STADLG-specified functions are therefore not called reliably, and are being deprecated. 

<p>Therefore, the alternative action is that if the make or break functions specified in STADLG.INI 
is NOOP or absent, the functions specified as <b>makecontrol=</b> and <b>breakcontrol=</b> in 
the <b>[RCONN]</b> section in <b>WinPCS.INI</b> will be used instead, the
same as with the 32-bit systems. This is reliable.

<h3>Disallowed functions:</h3>
DDE callback and document-drawing functions are only available inside the DDE 
callback and Printing callback environments.  

<h3>Functions that are not recommended:</h3>
Since make and break operations may occur in a noninteractive context, for example 
with FORKS, they should not normally  contain calls to functions that require user 
interaction, such as <a href="lcxh.html#message">message( )</a> or 
<a href="lcxh.html#input">input( )</a>. These functions are OK for development and 
trace printing purposes, however.  For the same reason, the DDE-initiating, 
status index dialog, and certificate functions are not recommended.

<p>Further calls to connect or disconnect the same kind of objects must not be attempted either; 
since this can cause an infinite recursion and eventually a crash. 

<h3>LCX files:</h3>
16-bit: Functions are expected to be found in the files referenced in <b>WinPCS.INI</b> in the <b>[RCONN]</b> 
section in the <b>make=</b> and <b>break=</b> entries. <p>

<h3>Callback functions:</h3>
<pre><em>code</em><b> = </b><em>makefunction</em><b>(</b><em>RCONN_operation_code</em><b>, </b><em>itemID</em><b>, </b><em>relID</em><b>)
</b><em>code</em><b> = </b><em>breakfunction</em><b>(</b><em>RCONN_operation_code</em><b>, </b><em>itemID</em><b>, </b><em>relID</em><b>)
</b></pre>

<h3>Arguments:</h3>
<em>RCONN_operation_code</em> is the operation code (this is usually the name of the relation table).
<em>itemID</em>, <em>relID</em> are the identities of the two objects being connected or disconnected.

<h3>Current records:</h3>
RCONN is positioned on the records where its fields OPERATION and ITEMBASE match the two 
tables being connected. The two tables (RCONN ITEMBASE and RELBASE) are 
positioned on their respective records, and the connection table's current record is tthe 
one to be deleted on break, or the data to be put into the new record on make.

<h3>Return Value:</h3>
<b>0</b> for OK, the system should proceed to make (Insert) or break (Delete) <br>
<b>-1</b> for indicating that the callback function did the make or break action and the system should not
perform the Insert or Delete action again. This may also be used for quiet failures. <br>
<b>-2</b> for fail with an error message. <br>
Connections are not changed (made or broken) by the system if the return value is negative.

<h3>Special replacements:</h3>
<b>NOOP</b><br>
<b>DISALLOW</b><br>

<h3>Execution context:</h3>
Not shared and not re-entered.
